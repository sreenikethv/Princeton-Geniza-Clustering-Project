448,Letter,"medicine, Jewish community, physician","Letter from Mufaḍḍal, probably in Fustat, to Abū l-Majd al-Melammed, in Qūṣ. In Judaeo-Arabic. Dating: Uncertain, but perhaps ca. 1230s CE, since T-S 13J26.6 (1234 CE) is a letter from Abū l-Majd in Qūṣ to Abū l-Mufaḍḍal in Fustat requesting guidance from the capital on communal affairs; if this decade is correct, plausible options are 1230 and 1237 CE (since the letter was written on Thursday, 1 Tammuz). Concerning a distinguished physician, evidently also the Head of the Jews (""Sayyidnā al-Rayyis"") whose burdensome medical responsibilities affected his ability to respond to the needs of the Jewish community. This physician is likely Avraham Maimonides based on the above identifications as well as corroborating evidence (cf. T-S 10J14.5 and Cohen's discussion of this possibility, pp. 134–35 in his article). The sender reports that two different queries for legal opinions (fatwās) had been sent to the physician in the Egyptian capital. He had misplaced the first query and had recovered it only after the second arrived. The sender informs the addressee, who had submitted the two questions, that the physician had composed an answer (jawāb) to both and it was enclosed it the present letter. The verso contains greetings from Abū l-Faraj, Abū l-Riḍā, Yosef, Hiba, and their mother, as well as the address. Upside down, there is also a list of medicinal herbs in Arabic script, unrelated to the letter. The scribe of this letter has distinctive handwriting with very tall, hooked lameds.

The latter have their rents listed, in order to compare the actual with the budgeted revenue. There is also a third class, of people who live in their apartments without paying rent. This is extremely unusual in the accounts of the qodesh and can only be explained by the extraordinary conditions of distress at the time. Seven apartments are listed as occupied rent-free; among them, that of R. Anatoli, whose rent was in any case reduced to five dirhams, as against 52 dirhams that he still paid three months earlier. Among the people exempt from payment are ""a poor woman"" and some scholars, one of them styled al-khaver.

505,Legal document,"11th c, Tyre","Deposition in the Jewish Court of Tyre, ca. 1028. The rent of a compound in Aleppo has been dedicated by its owner, Hilla b. Joseph, to the Great Synagogue in that city; the sons of Hilla, Mevorakh and Mufarrij, now live in Tyre. They declare before the court that the allegations of a certain man from Aleppo, who claims that the house was sold to him by their father, are vain and unfounded. The brothers insist twice upon the fact that it is the rent that was dedicated. They also insist on the fact that the man cannot prove the purchase, since he holds no deeds of purchase. The intention of the brothers to sell that house is apparent enough, though the relevant passage in this matter has unfortunately been damaged. They seem to be insisting that the dedication of the rent was on condition that it lapses if the heirs decide to sell it. Had the house itself been dedicated, the heirs would not have had a word to say about deeds of purchase nor would the case have been discussed in court at all. As we have it, the story behing the document seems to be that the late Hilla actually received money from the purchaser, but died before the deed of sale had been concluded. The heirs now strive to prevent the man from collecting the rent of the house, in order not to create a legal precedent, and keep the right to sell it at a convenient opportunity. The community of Aleppo probably claimed that the house itself had been dedicated. As to the claimant, he seems to have taken some steps to gain possession of the house, perhaps with the aid of a Muslim court. We have the therefore three parties involved in the case, with conflicting interests. The deposition of the brothers, as recorded by the court in Tyre, is preceded by a lenghty verified introduction, in a very flowery style, which forms the first half of the letter. The first part of the introduction is a eulogy, alphabetically arranged, to the learned people of Aleppo and their leader, the head of the court, R. Yaʿaqov b. Joseph. The letter is written in the hand of Shemuel b. Moshe. (Information from Gil, Documents, pp. 127-128 #2)"

In Judaeo-Arabic. Dating: ca. 1100 CE. Evidently this letter was never sent. The writer has spent the last five years in Egypt attempting to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. He describes the various disasters of the years 1095–1100 to justify both why he has failed to reach Jerusalem and why too he has remained in Egypt instead of returning to his family and waṭan. First, he describes the chaos in Palestine under the Seljuq occupation (""many armed bands made their appearance in Palestine""). He next describes the 1095 siege of Alexandria in which the vizier al-Afḍal deposed Nizār and secured the caliphate for al-Mustaʿlī (""the city was ruined. . . the Sultan conquered the city and caused justice to abound""). He again prepared for travel ""when God conquered Jerusalem at his [the caliph's] hands,"" i.e., in 1098, only to be foiled by the appearance of the Franks, who ""killed everyone in the city, whether Jew or Muslim."" The writer is confident that the Fatimids will retake Jerusalem this very year, so he intends to remain in Egypt until he sees Jerusalem or gives up all hope. The letter ends with the writer's protracted illnesses. Throughout these years, the land has been filled with epidemic diseases (wabā', aʿlāl, amrāḍ, dever). The wealthy became impoverished, ""most people died,"" entire families were destroyed. The writer himself developed a grave illness (maraḍ ṣaʿb), which lasted one year, and was shortly followed by another grave illness, which has lasted four years and perhaps continues to the present day. ""Indeed [true is] what the Scripture has said of the dreadful disease of Egypt (Deut. 7:15). . . . He who hiccups (yastanshiq) will not escape from it. . . . ailments and will die from them. . . . Otherwise, he will remain alive."" Note that ""yastanshiq"" typically means ""inhale"" or ""snuff"" (e.g., water for ritual ablutions) rather than ""hiccup.""

(3) Maʿālī will live with Manṣūr's daughter Milāḥ, likely the daughter of ʿAmāʾim (Goitein speculated that ʿAmāʾim must have suffered from a physical or mental illness preventing her from taking care of her own daughter). (4) Marriage payments: 2 + 15 = 17 dinars. (Information from M. A. Friedman's edition.)"

537,Letter,,"Letter from Natan b. Shemuel he-Ḥaver, in Fustat, to Petahya b. ʿOvadya ha-Kohen, in Damascus. Almost entirely in rhymed Hebrew with one sentence in Judaeo-Arabic in the margin of verso. Dated: Ḥeshvan 1453 Seleucid, which is October/November 1141 CE. Natan complains that his junior school friend has not written to him for a long time. He also conveys his greetings to Petahya's family. Natan's sons Mevorakh, Seʿadya, and Yehosef send their greetings. Natan concludes with a request for pens.

Goitein summarizes this document as follows (Med Soc V, p. 294): ""Judge Natan b. Shemuel he-ḥaver (Med. Soc, II, 513, sec. 18) served as secretary of the Damascus branch of the Jerusalem yeshiva, but accompanied Maṣliaḥ Gaon, when he opened a Cairene branch in 1127. In a letter from Fustat, dated October/November 1141, Natan complained bitterly about the addressee, Petahyahu ha-Kohen, a close companion of his youth, and two other friends in Damascus, from whom he had not received letters for years. True, in 1141 the Crusaders' kingdom separated Damascus from Egypt. But we know that Jews and Muslims were permitted to travel through the Christian territory, and our letter reports the arrival of a dignitary from Damascus carrying an eloquent epistle to the Egyptian Nagid written by Natan's friend Petahyahu. Natan does not complain about the Crusaders. He accuses Time: 'I complain about Time, the perfidious, the faithless, which disregards the claims of brotherhood and impedes its growing; it weakens and emaciates the love of friends. This is its character from its very beginning, incessantly urging separation, the treacherous robber! . . . It changed your relationship with me, you, my friend and beloved, whom I have reared on my knees, until I made you my equal.'"""

She claimed that her husband suffered from many illnesses and that his children from a previous marriage were irreligious. Malīḥa feared for the well-being of her children were she to die. We have a resolute petition written on her behalf to the head of the Jews, Maṣliaḥ ha-Kohen, informing him of the following: ""I am the wife of Adam, the money changer. For the past eight months, I have asked repeatedly for divorce, but could not obtain it. I had thought that with the arrival of your most venerable presence, you would not postpone giving a ruling to me or to another (on my behalf) a single hour. He is a man afflicted with many illnesses and sicknesses. He has children far removed from religion and others. The servant fears lest what is sealed upon people (i.e. death) overtake him, or me. There is no assurance what will happen with him and with my children.1 By the divine law that you possess! Examine my state and quickly issue a verdict, whatever it may be.2 The servant appointed a representative, but from all that was done to the man; he said that he would not return to mediate between us. The servant is bashful, I do not have a tongue to speak with. By your parents! Examine my state and please liberate me.3 .... All that I want is the liberation of the servant, by any means necessary. And what the divine law obligates.""4 We hear of Malīḥaʼs ultimate success in her bid for divorce in another document, T-S 8J5.4 2v. A four-line entry in a page from a court notebook records that on 28 June 1127, Malīḥa appointed Nathan ha-Levi b. Abraham as her representative to sue her husband. This short entry is followed by another entry recording an unrelated appointment of a representative. The next entry in the court notebook, however, records that on the very same day, a cantor who was one of the witnesses of the first appointment came to the court with two parnasim from the community. The three men declared to the court that they had made the symbolic purchase from Malīḥa confirming that she relinquished the entirety of her meʿuḥar and was willing to take an oath over her claims regarding the dowry. Her husband also made the symbolic purchase confirming that he had no claim over her.

A fragment of a report, or memorandum, about the compound known as Dar Naqa that figures in several documents of the qodesh. The history of the dedication of one quarter of this compound to the qodesh is briefly reviewed. It appears that it had been dedicated in the 11th century, for the purpose of charity for both the Rabbanite and Karaite needy. During a period of persecution and confiscation that occurred in the year 1127, a sum of money was kept by an official of the qodesh; in order to prevent its confiscation, the money was registered as having already been spent on the purchase of the half of that compound. The purpose of the memorandum is to justify that fictitious record, and probably also to make clear what part of Dar Naqa actually belonged to the qodesh.

The expenditures include khikr, nightwatch, oil for the synagogues, payments to scholars and to the poor, maintenance and repairs. The total expenditure is 472 dirhams, so there is a surplus of 134.25 dirhams, after the deduction of a collection fee of 60 dirhams.

Ḥananya (in office 1140–59). She is an ""unprotected woman"" (marʾa munqaṭiʿa) whose father could not support her and whose brother was a young boy with no connections. She explains that she “got stuck” with a man who was not ashamed of the bad things people had said about him (or maybe of the bad things of which he himself speaks?). The petition was written after a legal proceeding in which the Nagid ordered the husband to restore the ketubba to its original wording (apparently the husband had decreased the sum stated in the ketubba). However, now the husband has taken an oath that he would restore only ten dinars, a lower sum than previously agreed upon. The husband apparently managed to ignore the Nagidʼs commands by finding someone who supported him in his claims. The wife had been getting advice from her congregation and from the local judge, but, she writes, she is fed up with words and no action. The judge, for example, told her brother to leave the matter until Sunday, but “Sunday came and nothing was done for my issue except postponement.” She complains that she is treated “as if it was I who has done something unpermitted” (ḥattā ka-annī qad ʿamiltu shayʾ lā yanṣāgh (!) – for the last word (=yanṣāgh) see Blau, Dictionary, 379). Even a ruling of the Nagid was subjected to a process of negotiation at the local level until it was watered down to ineffectiveness. The same matter is also mentioned briefly in T-S 10J17.22.

It is a draft of a statement (tiqrār) to be signed by Maimonides, the Judges and the Elders, to the effect that Avraham b. Yaḥyā ha-Levi, called al-Najīb, should get the payment of his capitation tax (jizya) to the amount of 1 2/3 dinars out of the revenue from the rents of a ""block"" (rabʿ) which was a pious foundation earmarked for poor people. Thus Avraham's capitation tax will be paid from the revenue of the qodesh, not as charity, but as compensation for fees which he once renounced for supervising repairs in the funduq. The text stresses the great benefit which would accrue from his continued presence at such repairs. This payment was to be in the place of a daily salary of 1/2 dirham to which al-Najīb was entitled for his supervision of the building of the Funduq ('hotel' or caravenserai), erected by Abū ʿImran Beḥir ha-Kohanim, certainly also a public building. The remuneration of 1/2 dirham normally was paid out of a daily emolument of 2 dirhams which the Wakīl or administrator of the building received. The statement is not signed, perhaps because Maimonides objected to such a vague agreement made in respect of the spending of money destined for the poor.

Little of the substance is preserved, but it is interesting that the senders ask for the letter to be read aloud in public (in Ramla or Jerusalem). (2) Letter from Yosef b. Ibn Abitūr to Shemuel ha-Kohen b. Yosef. This one is not digitized on PGP yet. Ibn Abitūr's main goal in this letter is to get the Gaon to reiterate an excommunication on a certain person which Ibn Abitūr already excommunicated, but who refuses to repent. Ibn Abitūr also asks the Gaon to excommunicate other persons, ""who are aiding this wicked man, inciting him to remain streadfast and to further claim that he will be flogged, he will apostatize"" ( yeṣē mi-dīnō le-tarbūt ra̔ah יצא מדינו לתרבות רעה).

The sender reports that the letter of the Rosh Yeshiva Yoshiyyahu arrived, and it was read aloud in the synagogue. Apparently Yoshiyyahu was soliciting funds for the Jerusalem Yeshiva, and this letter is excusing the congregation for failing to donate anything. The reason is that the capitation tax has been increased to 4 1/3 טריים per head. There may be reference to a specific family (his own?) that owes the tax for four people. He claims that many of the Jews of Sicily have fled ""due to fear from the rulers of the land."" The community does not like to send a letter to the Rosh Yeshiva without a little money enclosed. The letter was written in Elul, and the sender says he will try to raise some funds in Tishrei.

Since the couple own nine qarārīṭ (=3/8) of the house of which the qodesh owns the rest, the repairs needed in the house could not be made without their collaboration.

Fragment of an accounting between the qodesh and, apparently, its partner in the ownership of a compound, known as Hiba al-Abzari, one eighth of which belongs to the qodesh. This can be inferred from the fact that the qodesh returns sums previously paid by that man for the ground rent (ḥikr). A former agreement seems to have imposed monthly payments of 10 dinars upon the co-proprietor, to settle his debt. The new computation stretches over a period of nine years, 1149-1158 - years 1461, 1465, 1466 sel. (1149-50, 1154, 1155), and years (5)50, (5)51, (5)52, (5)53 AH (1155-1158 CE).

Saʿīd takes several oaths that if Musāfir shows the court a letter from Tyre (presumably attesting that the diadem never arrived), he will pay a fine of 10 dinars to the qodesh for the poor of Jerusalem. Musāfir then produces exactly such a letter. Saʿīd then claims that his oath was only about a letter from Tyre from his father-in-law. Musāfir then shows the court letters from the father-in-law.

The main outcome has to do with Sittāna's burial expenses should she die before her husband. According to Jewish law, burial expenses are incumbent on the husband if he outlives his wife; in exchange, he inherits her property. (Whereas if he dies first, it is the wife's family who buries her and inherits her property.) In the present document, Shelomo commits to this obligation and, moreover, to bury her in the same quality of clothing that she has been accustomed to wear (""with which I clothed her"") in her lifetime. To this end, the document lists the kinds of clothes she wears. Witnesses: the scribe [...] b. Shemuel ha-Kohen; Fashshāṭ b. Shemuel (who also signed T-S 16.49 and T-S 12.496); and Baqāʾ b.

Moshe b. Sughmār, the chief judge in al-Mahdiyya, to Nahray b. Nissim, in Fustat. Dating: Ca. 3 August 1057 CE (Gil) or 1061 CE (Goitein). Goitein explains, ""Our letter was written after 1057, the date of the ruin of Qayrawān, when R. Nissim (b. Yaʿaqov) and other inhabitants of that city had found refuge in Sūsa, a seaport on the Tunisian coast north of al-Mahdiyya. R. Nissim died in 1062.The reference to the Sicilian city whose male inhabitants were put to sword by the conquering Normans fits the fall of Messina in 1061."" Labrāṭ extols the great rabbinical authority R. Nissim b. Yaʿaqov, and his pupil the enigmatic ""Rav"" of Egypt. At the time of the writing of this letter, R. Nissim lived in Sūsa. There he supervised the copying of his writings, which was done for the Qayrawān scholar, Nahray b. Nissim, who then lived in Egypt. The letter relates how R. Nissim's writings were transferred to Egypt, an important detail, which sheds light on the value of the Geniza fragments of these writings, which have been published by Sheraga Abramson. Labrāṭ reports on the progress of the court case that Nahray b. Natan brought against his brother Yisrael b. Natan (both of them the cousins of Nahray b. Nissim) regarding the inheritance of their father's estate. The letter hails the zeal and progress made in Jewish learning by a son of R. Natan b. Avraham, Av ha-Yeshiva, the sometime Gaon of the Palestinian academy. The letter concludes with a report of the conquests made by the Normans in Sicily. The reference is to their taking of Messina by assault, and the losses suffered by Jews and, in particular, by Muslims. The writer expresses apprehensions with regard to the import of grain from Sicily, since Tunisia itself, a primarily agricultural country, had been laid waste by the invasion of the Arab tribes. Labrāṭ opens the letter with copious well wishes to Nahray because of his eye disease (wajaʿ ʿayn and ḍuʿf ʿayn) and conveys well wishes to Nahray on behalf of R. Nissim (r4–11). Goitein cites this letter as an excellent example of the convention of expressing preoccupation for a sick correspondent and conveying congratulations upon his recovery: ""After having read the bad tidings in Nahray's missives, [Labrāṭ] had become disquieted and frightened, and passed his sleepless nights in asking God to accept himself as Nahray's ransom and to heal him. He had also passed the news on to ""the Light of the World"" (the spiritual leader of the Tunisian Jews), who was also very worried about it; his prayer for Nahray, Labrāṭ is confident, would be accepted. Finally, the merchants arriving from Egypt reported that Nahray was well and his eyes restored, whereupon Labrat praised and thanked God. He would be set at rest, however, only by a personal letter from Nahray confirming this happy turn of events"" (Goitein, Med Soc V, p. 111). Labrāṭ goes on to describe the serious illness of R. Nissim himself (r14–18). All had despaired, ""but God looked upon us and did not afflict us and blind our eyes."" R. Nissim recovered, but the remnants of the illness did not leave him for a long time. Information from Goitein and Gil. There are photostats and an edition in Goitein's notes (to be uploaded). ASE."

Ṣadoq b. Mevorakh Rosh ha-Qehillot. Sitt al-Ahl is the wife of Abū l-Faraj Yeshuʿa b. Yehuda. Sitt al-Ahl's mother is Ḥasana bt. Shelomo ha-Kohen, the sister of the well-known judge Natan b. Shelomo. She is close to giving birth and contemplating dying during childbirth and seeks to provide for the child “male or female” who would survive the mother. The woman bequeaths generously to relatives and charities, including “forty dinars to the ""mastūrīn"" poor in Cairo and Fustat. ""The woman's husband had children from a previous marriage, and she was, therefore particularly eager to safeguard the future of the child she was expecting. This had already been done to a large extent in her marriage contract, where it was stipulated that the dowry which she brought in, as well as payments due to her, would go to her children, to the exclusion of other heirs of her husband. In addition, she now wants half of a house, given by her to her mother prior to her marriage, to revert to her future child. The other half belonged to her, and both she and her husband were eager that the whole should become the property of the expected newborn. The old lady, however, had earmarked 60% of her share for her brother and nieces and 40% for charitable purposes. In view of this, our document stipulates that the gifts intended by the old woman will be made by her son-in-law in case after her death, while the half of the house referred to will be registered as property of the newborn. The expecting mother belonged to one of the leading families of the community, as her grandfather was Mevorakh Rosh ha-Qehillot, a man prominent in the politics of the community in the middle of the 11th century. On the other hand, her maternal uncle, the judge Natan ha-Kohen b. Shelomo, signatory of many documents in Fustat during the years 1122–48, was a refugee from Palestine, which was occupied at that time by the crusaders. It stands to reason that her mother, too, had come from Palestine and had, therefore, no possessions of her own in Cairo. This explains why she was given in her old age, one-half of a house by her daughter, who had inherited or received it as a gift from her father's family, or perhaps left to her by a former husband.""

Joseph the Dyer releases Samuel ha-Kohen b. Moses b. Ṣemaḥ from all claims, and relinquishes any claim to funds owed by a number of named individuals in Malīj. These debts may have been accounts receivable, or may have been partnership investments made by ‘Ammār and Samuel. Goitein suggests that the document was written on 9 Tishri (Erev Yom Kippur) ""because people from Malīj, where the workshop was operated, had come to Fusṭāṭ for [the holiday] and were able to witness the release"", though Lieberman says there is no evidence that any of the witnesses came from Malīj. Still,  the court in Fusṭāṭ may have been busy just before Yom Kippur, with litigants wanting to set their affairs in order before the holiday began – this could explain the number of witnesses. It may be no coincidence that this release from partnership obligations is written just before the festival which marks divine release from transgressions in the year which has just ended. Goitein characterizes this as an ""industrial"" partnership centered around a workshop, because ‘Ammār is identified as a dyer. But there are no details concerning the object and nature of the partnership itself, and ‘Ammār leaves all claims to Samuel, leaving open the possibility that he was not the principal, but was instead working for Samuel.

Marduk notes that a baqyar (large-sized turban) 25 cubits long was made for Nahray, along with a bolt of cloth 20 cubits long. He further reports that ‘Atiyya b. Shammāʿ brought him a blue kerchief containing cotton, [linen] yarn and unraveled flax, which would be combined with yarn previously sent — and currently in the hands of the artisan — to produce another cloth, but that since the yarns were of different qualities, it didn't bleach well. The letter reveals the importance of Alexandria as a center of textile weaving: in this case, yarn and other raw materials (e.g., combed flax—kattān manfūsh) were sent from Fustat to Alexandria for processing into finished products. The length of Nahray's turban, 25 cubits, is noteworthy and confirms the importance of this item of headgear as a symbol of status. Another interesting detail is the process of bargaining with artisans: the price for certain work is fixed, and as the work proceeds, attempts are made to bargain down the price at various stages; this
continues even after the work has been completed. The processes connected with weaving that are
either mentioned or implied in this letter are:
a)	ghazl: spinning
b)	ḥall al-ghazl: unravelling the yarn
c)	tasfiya: bleaching
d)	tabyīḍ; whitening (re: flax and linen)
e)	qasr: fulling/cleaning of woven material

991,Letter,,"Letter from Shelomo b. Yehuda to a personality in Fustat. Dating (Gil): ca. 1030 CE. Describes the aftermath of the excommunication of the Qaraites on the Mount of Olives on Hoshaʿna Rabba in 1029. The Qaraites had demanded that those who declared the ḥerem, who were now imprisoned in Damascus, would ""never again be called by the title ḥaver and never serve the house of Israel in all of Palestine, in greater or lesser service, neither in law nor in any other matter” (quotation from T-S 13J13.28 + T-S AS 120.62, PGPID 949). There followed a meeting in the market in Ramla to discuss the Qaraite demands; the gaʾon says that he asked “that the matter be resolved without a stipulation [being placed] either upon or against” the Rabbanites. The Qaraites refused: “Rather, they said, ‘Our time has come! This is the day we have hoped for; we have lived to see it!"" (Lamentations 2:16) Then he goes off on a long aside complaining about the Qaraites elders of Jerusalem — in a more intimate tone than in his vatic Hebrew letters: they can't agree on a single point of law (""they differ from each other in school of law, each one forming his own madhhab""), yet they are unanimous in their hatred of the Rabbanites. He refers obliquely and mockingly to Qaraite authors such as Daniʾel al-Qūmisī, Salmon b. Yeroḥam and Yefet b. ʿEli: ""They see themselves as ‘lilies’ (shoshanim) and everyone else as ‘thorns’; they consider themselves ‘wise ones’ (maskilim), but they disagree as to who among them is wise.” Some other details of this live polemic session are equally fascinating: the gaʾon complains about their lack of fellow-feeling, and the Qaraites retort that they're the ones serving the state in the interest of the Jewish collectivity: “They should be ashamed. Which of us is obligated to his followers concerning the many laws of Israel that are not written, we or they? But when one mentions this to them, they feel ashamed and say, ‘It is not so. If God, may He be exalted, gave us a high position in the service of power [fī khidmat sulṭān], it was so that our followers might attain their wishes over others.” In response to which the gaʾon drops a short citation from Ecclesiastes (7:15–18) warning against attributing worldly success to divine favor: “[Sometimes a righteous man perishes in spite of his righteousness, and sometimes a wicked one endures in spite of his wickedness. So do not be excessively righteous or excessively wise, or you might be disappointed, and do not be excessively wicked or excessively foolish, or you might die before your time.] It is best to grasp one without letting go of the other.” Then he continues complaining about the Qaraites' lack of fellow-feeling while noting that they nonetheless continue to marry Rabbanites:  ""They have marked us with the status of one whose prayer God does not accept, but if to them we appear thus, why should they procreate with us or marry us?"" He then refers to the continuation of the affair: the Rabbanites had succeeded in blocking the Qaraite demands through the mediation of Fatimid officials: “‘Blessed is the Lord, God of our fathers, who put it into the mind of ’our lord ‘the king’ [cf. Ezra 7:27], may he live forever, and into the mind of our lord the vizier, may God save him, to speak on our behalf and to seek what is good for us, may His name be elevated for all eternity.” Presumably this refers to T-S 13J7.29 (PGPID 1243), a decree of al-Ẓāhir to the governor of Palestine, Anūshtakīn al-Duzbarī, ordering him not to show partiality in his treatment of “the two parties,” a decree issued in response to a petition from the gaʾon's party. Then he goes on to describe how some Rabbanites in Jerusalem had spread a rumor saying that the Qaraites had burnt three Rabbanite figures in effigy on Purim. He sends the elders Abū l-Barakāt Netanʾel ha- Kohen and Abū ʿAlī Muḥsin b. Ḥusayn on a fact-finding mission, and the effigy story turns out to be slander; Abū ʿAlī Muḥsin b. Ḥusayn advises the gaʾon ""that I had no way out of this libel but to announce an excommunication on whoever did what was said and on whoever spread slander of non-existent things in order to endanger people.” The gaʾon complies and declares another ban ""on a fast day in the majlis in the Jewish market” in Ramla, urging his followers ""not to exact retribution on them (the Qaraites) for what they have inflicted upon us.” The assembly answered: “Cast the ban and cast the ban! Behold, we are suffering mightily from the terrible thing they (the slanderers) have said, even though it happened against our will. [Cast the ban] lest a decree [ḥujja] be issued against us [saying] that this happened because of us!” So he did (verso): “we cast the ban and we ended [the affair], but it troubled many of them, since they knew that they were [the ones] bringing this about.” (Information from Rustow, Heresy, 218–26.)

The letter contains a request for Ḥalfon to come to Alexandria to settle the disputes caused by Yehuda ha-Levi’s presence in the city. The letter also refers to business matters arising from the India trade, in which both the addressee and the writer were involved. Abū Naṣr complains about his eye illness: ""I only wrote these few letters as I was housebound with a flare of ophthalmia that came over me."" At the end of recto and beginning of verso, this proves relevant: ""The account is in the shop and I am at home, so I do not have the precise details to inform you."" Finally, in the last few lines, ""Please extend forgiveness, God knows that I wrote this with the kerchief (khirqa) draped (musabala) over my eyes.""

In the document, Mōda‘ calls upon Abū al-Faraj al-Bazzāz to testify that Mōda‘ has an interest in the partnership, while Abraham seems to claim that he or he and his wife are the sole owners of the capital. Abraham apparently invested capital with Mōda‘ for the operation of a shop, and upon distribution of the profits it became unclear whether the capital was intended to be simply a deposit with Mōda‘ or if it would be (per Maimonides) ""half a loan…and half a deposit"". Apparently, these details were left unspecified when Mōda‘ first became involved in the venture. Subsequently, Mōda‘ seems to have called two individuals – one (perhaps a scholar) identified only as Head of the Congregations (""Rosh ha-Qehillot""), and Abū al-Faraj – to the shop to clarify the nature of his relationship with Abraham. Thus, the present document reports that the Head of the Congregations affirmed in a qinyan that Mōda‘ was indeed a partner with Abraham and not simply an employee. Signed by Abraham b.

This document was drawn up following the termination and settlement of a commenda between Solomon b. David al-Dustarī/al-Tustarī and Benaiah b. Moses. As part of the settlement, Solomon was allocated ten dinars and change, five dinars and one qirāṭ to be paid immediately by Benaiah. The balance is to be collected by Solomon, acting as an agent to collect on debts owed by Jacob al-Ḥarīrī and Jacob al-Ṣabbāgh to Benaiah. The debtors will then make monthly payments of the balance to Solomon. Benaiah stands as guarantor for the debts. This document is a final release from Solomon to Benaiah, leaving only the uncollected debts. Goitein writes that ""the investor lost almost 50 out of 70 dinars confided to an overseas trader, but was convinced by ‘the elders of the community’ that he had no claim against him."" The ""convincing"" seems to have been the normal settlement procedure required for release; though the document refers to the agreement as a commenda (muḍāraba), its details don't confirm that it totally follows the model of the Islamic muḍāraba – for example, the active partner is left owing funds to the investor, suggesting that simply liquidating the invested assets was insufficient to satisfy his obligations to the latter. However, had the active partner borne no responsibility for loss (as in an Islamic muḍāraba), this would have sufficed. The verso – as yet untranscribed – is a form for a power of attorney, with ""John Doe"" substituted for parties’ names.

The inquiry has shown that there were no real arrears, but to make the matter totally right, a copper lid left by the tenant was to be handed over to Abu'l-Bayan, apparently one of the prominent leaders of the congregation of the Palestinians, in order to spare the parnasim his reproaches.

The poor man Ma‘ani’s son was circumcised by Yefet ha-Qatzar instead, pro bono. Moshe now gets to the point of the letter: he has heard that Ibn al-Ṭaffāl slandered him to Sar Shalom, claiming that he said things against the Gaon that he never said. Moshe concludes by begging for mercy: he insists that has not done anything wrong, Sar Shalom must not believe anything without witnesses and proofs, and, finally, who is he that Sar Shalom should be angry at him? “After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea” (1 Samuel 24:14). On verso, he apologizes for the poor quality of the paper, stating that it was the best he could find, and for the poor quality of his writing.

The writer, a physician, even expresses the expectation that the Emperor might take Aleppo and Damascus as well and already placed an order for medical books which would be looted there from the homes of his colleagues."" The writer had emigrated from Fatimid Egypt to Byzantium. Goitein suggests that he traveled initially with the Fatimid navy, as he lists letters he sent in previous years from the army camp at Jaffa, from Rhodes, and from the island of Chios, which were occupied by the Venetian navy in 1224. The physician also stayed in Constantinople before settling in Seleucia and marring a woman with a Greek name (Korasi). He repeatedly describes how wealthy he is despite having arrived penniless, and urges his in-laws to follow his example and join him, no matter how much they have to leave behind.

1050,Letter,Yefet b. Menashshe,"Letter from Yefet b. Menashshe to his brother Abū l-Surūr Peraḥya b. Menashshe. In Judaeo-Arabic. This is a complete and well-preserved letter, which is rare in the Yefet corpus. Goitein's note card points out that Yefet and Peraḥya are the two brothers of Ḥalfon b. Menashshe ha-Levi Ibn al-Qaṭāʾīf and that the brothers also had at least two sisters. In this letter, Yefet thanks Peraḥya for the 10 dirhams for their mother and conveys her prayers for him and for Ḥalfon (from this Goitein deduces that Ḥalfon and Peraḥya regularly supported their mother and sisters in the Rīf, but note that in other letters the mother and sisters appear to be in Fustat). Yefet reports that the cassia fistula (khiyār shanbar) and gum (ṣamgh) arrived. Yefet sent to Ḥalfon the bitumen (uṣūl(?) al-qifār) which he had requested. Regards to Sitt Naʿīm (Ḥalfon's wife). ʿIwāḍ told Yefet that Peraḥya complained about Yefet's failure to write him letters, which Yefet now strenuously denies: ""[I write to you] even when I have nothing to say except to ask after you and your health.""

In Judaeo-Arabic, with the address in Arabic script. Dating: Tuesday, 11 Tishrei, probably October 1038 CE (according to both Gil and Goitein). The letter congratulates Sahlān on his marriage, which we know to have taken place on 9 September 1037 CE, from his ketubba (T-S 20.6). The letter also discusses difficulties experienced by the Babylonian/Iraqi congregation of Fustat that were resolved with the intervention of Abū Naṣr Ḥesed al-Tustarī (ll. 13 and 16). Daniel is working on these matters together with the Rosh ha-Gola, at present in the Maghrib, and with the Nagid of Qayrawān (Yaʿaqov b. ʿAmram or Shemuel ha-Sefaradi). The Arabic-script address on verso references Sahlān’s late father Ibrāhīm b. Sahlān (d. ca. 1031), previously the head of the Iraqi community of Fustat, and refers to him as “Barhūn.” The letter briefly mentions Sahlān's deliverance from an illness, but this part of the letter is too damaged to discern any more information (l. 8).

Dating: 1050–55 CE, based on the likely identifications of Ḥaydara and Khaṭīr al-Mulk. ""The extortion of payments of the capitation tax in advance is thus far known from Geniza records only for Palestine and for the second quarter of the eleventh century, a period of anarchy and misrule. According to one report, payment was asked a full five months before the Muslim New Year on which it was due."" (Goitein, Med Soc II, p. 389.) The story in the document is very interesting. The sender describes that the Bedouins (הערביים) gained control over the city and collaborated with a judge, the nephew of Abū l-Sayyār(?), to cut off the water supply of the Jews. Whenever the Jews succeeded in swaying a ruler (כל מושל ושליט) to restore the water supply, their enemies united and denied that the Jews had any right to the water. Another ruler (shaliṭ) came to power this year, named Ḥaydara Dhakhīrat al-Dawla (appears also in T-S K25.249 in 1031 CE). The community sent emissaries to Egypt to obtain ""a document (ketav) and a decree (nishtevan)"" with three requests: (1) to restore the water supply, (2) to restore the right of slaughtering in the market, and (3) to prohibit collection of the (capitation) tax before the year has begun. The requests were accepted and the decree was issued by Khatīr al-Mulk (=the son of al-Yāzūrī, or possibly al-Yāzūrī himself; see Yaacov Lev, Administration of Justice in Medieval Egypt, p. 145)\. However, the ruler ""read (the documents and the decree) and cast them from his hand"" and demanded hefty bribes before fulfilling any of the injunctions. The Jews' enemies were outraged and protested, but gave up in disgrace when the ruler said that they would have to obtain a counter-decree annulling the first one. Nevertheless, the judge of the city persisted in demanding the capitation tax 5 months ahead of time, 250 gold coins from the community. On verso there are communal accounts in Arabic script—see separate record.  For further analysis and identifications of the state officials involved, see Gil, History of Palestine, sec. 599, and Rustow, Lost Archive, p. 255."

Abū l-Munā al-ʿAṭṭār al-Iskandarānī, the wife of Abū Naṣr al-Ḥalabī al-Tājir. Witnesses: Yosef b. Thābit ha-Levi; Shelomo b. Natan ha-Haver. ""This remarkable deathbed declaration, on the one hand, shows the cosmopolitan character of Fustat: the daughter of a druggist called 'the Alexandrian' was married there to a merchant 'from Aleppo.' On the other hand, it betrays an extraordinary attachment of the testator to her paternal family and to local customs and concepts. The dying woman's husband was a tājir, or great merchant, who traveled far and was expected to be away from home for several years. He probably was on a business trip to India. She had a little boy (Mūsā) from a former marriage, who lived with her parents. As his guardian and her own executor she appointed a brother of her former husband (Abū Mūsā Hārūn/Aharon b. Yeshuʿa ha-Kohen). The main purport of the will was the legal protection of her parents, brother (Abū l-Surūr), and boy against her present husband and providing a sumptuous burial for herself. She wanted to have Muslim wailing women, presumably because the cries and shrieks of Jewish women exercising the same profession were not shrill enough for her taste. The most impressive detail is her wish to be buried together with 'one of her family' meaning her father, mother, or brother. To these she was attached by 'natural ties'; with her husband she was connected solely by a 'contract.'"" There is also a clause about Sitt al-Ahl's female slave named Fūq and Fūq's daughter, who belongs to Sitt al-Ahl's mother. Sitt al-Ahl also intends for the daughter of her brother Abū l-Surūr to marry her son Mūsā.

Ḥassān al-Mahdawī, took purple dye materials to Upper Egypt and sold it there. Conflict ensued, perhaps when the partners divided up profits or losses from the sale of the dye (since the division isn't specified in the document). The mutual release was complete, except for a payment of two dinars to be made from Joseph to Khalaf according to a payment schedule described in the document. If Joseph fails to make full payment, he must make a donation to the poor in the same amount as he owes. Khalaf is to be trusted (presumably, without an oath) concerning Joseph's payments. Despite the aforementioned penalty clause, Joseph apparently took longer  than expected to repay the two dinars, since the final release which appears on the verso is dated six months after the end of the loan repayment period, in 1144.

The nature of the tax is not specified; Goitein presumes that it was for the tax on the manufacture, dyeing, and sale of silk. The declaration begins, ""I had intended to take over the tax farming of al-Maḥalla al-Kubrā, which is in the hand of the elder Abū l-Faraj Yeshuʿa b. Avraham and of his son Abū l-Khayr. Then I pondered over the straitened circumstances of these people, their liabilities and indebtedness to the dīwān and thought that if I took that thing from them through machinations, force, and getting the better of them, they would suffer damage, both from the side of their relation with the dīwān and their loss of income. Thus, considering their welfare prior to my own and confident that with God's favorable decree and help the welfare of all us would be served, I make this proposal."" The value of the tax farming lease is 335 dinars per year. The proposal is that they will transfer the rights to the tax farm to Abū l-Riḍā, and he will pay their debt of 80 dinars to the dīwān in four annual installments of 20 dinars. If the superintendent (mushrif) and director (ʿāmil) of the diwan raise the sum owed for the new tax farmer, the amount of the 'rise' (ziyāda) will be deducted from the 80 dinars.

Dating: 1127–38 CE. In Judaeo-Arabic and Hebrew. The purpose of the letter is to beseech Maṣliaḥ to investigate the matter of the death of a family member of the writer, a case with which Maṣliaḥ was clearly somewhat familiar already. It seems that the legal proceedings in Alexandria had not gone in the writer's favor, and he blames a group of evildoers not only for this but also for the death of the family member in the first place. The writer opens with the rabbinic dictum (Bava Meṣiʿa 58b) that verbal oppression is graver than monetary oppression, because the latter can be restituted but the former cannot. This is all the more true, he adds, when frauds or conspiracies (ghabā'in) have been perpetrated on somebody. He continues by saying that a physician who has personal experience of illness and treatment is all the more effective in treating others; that Maṣliaḥ himself has been the victim of conspiracy of rank (? ḥāl) and money (māl), but God in his mercy restored to each person what they deserved; thus, Maṣliaḥ will be the most suitable person to take up the case the writer is about to present, which is one of conspiracy of rank and money and family and connections (? wasā'iṭ) and witnesses. Indeed, there is a group of well-known evildoers in Alexandria who seek to pervert justice and corrupt the judges, and make it appear as if their victims are the ones at fault. As for the dead man (l. 20f), and how he lost his mind and perished after drinking the medicine—what truly killed him, according to the writer, was the fact that he had been slandered by others who complained about him to Maṣliaḥ, when in fact the dead man was the one who was wronged and ought to have been the one complaining. The writer's only desire is for Maṣliaḥ to conduct a thorough investigation into the matter. The writer prefers this to the entire inheritance, for which he has no need. He then cites a (sadly faded) saying of certain physicians about the delirium (hadhayān) that certain illnesses produce; all the more so for someone (the dead man) who suffered multiple illnesses, of mind, of body, and a conspiracy (ghabīna) against him. He concludes with formulaic praises and pleas, and finally writes, cryptically, ""Ben Zoma is still outside"" (Ḥagiga 15a). ASE."

Shaʾul b. Yisraʾel ha-Ṭulayṭulī, in Jerusalem, to his sister Ballūṭa in Toledo. Dated at the last line: the month of Marḥeshvan 4818 AM, October-November 1056 CE. The writer (a Rabbanite) relays two years of news about Qaraites and fellow Andalusians in Jerusalem, as well as family news. He conveys the distress he felt upon hearing of the epidemic (wabā') and unrest (tashwīsh) in the environs of Toledo. One theme of the letter is their father's health. ""Our father is in a state that one would wish only for one's enemies. He has become paralyzed (mabṭūl), blind (aʿmā), and feeble-minded (madkhūl al-dhihn), and suffers much (mumtaḥin). The bearers of this letter will tell you about him and about my care for him. He does not lack a thing, for he is well served (makhdūm) and cared for (maḥfūẓ). I do not rely on anyone else to concern themselves with him. My bed adjoins his; I get up several times every night to cover him and to turn him, since he is not able to do any of these things alone (idh lā yamlik min nafsihi shay'). May God, the exalted, reward him for his sufferings."" Med Soc III, p. 241. Later in the letter, Shimʿon tells Ballūṭa that she need not concern herself with sending the turban that had been requested, ""for, woe is me, he no longer has the wherewithal to leave the door of the house. He used to devote himself (wādhāb should be read as wāẓāb) to the Mount of Olives and to God's Temple for as long as he was able and [the strength] was in him, may God reward him."" (Gil's translation diverges significantly from this.) A second theme of the letter is the story of a fellow Toledan, Ibrāhīm b. Fadānj, and his wife, who arrived two years earlier after having been taken captive in Byzantium and redeemed in Ramle.

For each stage the names of the parnasim who were in charge of the qodesh are listed. At the end of the 10th century apparently only two or three compounds comprised the real estate dedicated to the Synagogue of the Palestinians.

Several major repairs of the extant buildings and also repairs and improvements in the synagogue are listed. The main part of the document deals with the period of the persecuations under al-Hakim. The synagogues were destroyed and the materials they were made of sold by the Muslim authorities. Later, the period of reconstruction is recorded.

1271,Letter,"illness letter 969-1517, Salonica, old age, Byzantium, disability, disability: vision, Illness, disability: hearing, disability: frailty","Letter from a blind man in Salonica to his son Ismāʿīl in Egypt. In Judaeo-Arabic. Written on vellum in a scholarly hand. The first page of the letter is lost. Dating: 1088/89 CE, or shortly after, based on Goitein's interpretation of the year ""48"" as 4848 AM. The letter picks up with the father explaining his happy situation in Salonica and why he cannot possibly return to Egypt, as his son had asked him to do (r1–19). The writer lives in Salonica with his wife (not the addressee's mother) and a daughter with many suitors. He fears that they would be a burden on the family in Egypt. He is blind and weak—""I have nothing left but my tongue and my heart"" (i.e., mind)—but he has not perished. On the contrary, he is in a thousand states of well-being and is highly regarded by all who fear God. He overhears the Shabbat services from his dwelling. None of the scholars of Salonica are able to match him in his knowledge of the law. He next sends regards to various family members and congratulates his son on the acquisition of noble in-laws (r20–27). He is worried about his family, because he heard that ""in the year 48 the Nile had a low flood, and my heart trembled, and I have no rest, neither by day or by night. For God's sake, write me immediately regarding your well-being"" and about each person's livelihood (r27–32). The son should send his response to ʿImrān b. Naḥum in Alexandria who will forward it to Salonica, to the upper synagogue, to the house of Shabbetay b. Moshe Matakla 'the head' (r33–36). He exhorts his son not to neglect the study of Torah or be distracted by his business affairs (r36–v1). He then recapitulates the reasons for his departure from Egypt 26 years earlier and what has happened in the interim (v1–v21). It seems his motives for traveling were both pious (wishing to bury his bones in Jerusalem) and financial. At first he sent all the money he earned back to his family, and had none with which to travel back himself. He traveled from place to place for 30 months. At that time he learned that a business partner of the family perished in a fire, from which point onward, ""I never had anything but expenses."" The 'Turks' then invaded the Byzantine east, so he fled to the west, ultimately reaching Salonica. His vision weakened, gradually, over the course of five years. In Salonica, he has refrained from granting his daughter to any of her many suitors until he received word from his son and his brother-in-law Abū l-Ḥ̋asan. The writer then returns to the subject of why he cannot possibly travel back to Egypt (v21–v34). Even as his son's letter was read to him, he had no strength to go out his door or leave his house without being supported. He can hardly see or hear. If his son saw him, he would ""flee the distance of a month's journey."" This is apart from the grave danger of the travel itself and his anxiety on account of his old age and his wife—even though she herself would love to travel. It is not in his nature to save money, and he repeats his fear that he would be a burden on the family. There is then a cryptic passage (v30–34) warning his son against listening to 'a generation that left us' and which had various faults that cannot be written in a letter. He concludes (v34–39) with another exhortation to study Torah diligently. When the son was 13 years old, he used to astound people with his intelligence.

1344,Letter,"communal, condolence, conversion, Daniel b. Azarya, conflict","Letter from an ardent supporter to Daniel b. ʿAzarya. In Judaeo-Arabic. Dating: Ca. 1055 CE (per Goitein). This is the first leaf of a longer letter. The sender puts his money and his friends at Daniel's disposal. The letter is also an attack on ʿEli b. ʿAmram, who is never directly named. The sender describes communal strife in Fustat after the death of the gaon Shelomo b. Yehuda (d. 1051) and Abū Kathīr Efrayim b. Shemarya (d. after 1053 CE, probably ca. 1055 CE). The other supporters of Daniel b. ʿAzarya wanted to appoint the Rav (=Yehuda b. Yosef) as the successor of Efrayim b. Shemarya, and they did not want ʿEli b. ʿAmram to assume the position. (The Rav was in the camp of Daniel b. ʿAzarya despite being the cousin of his rivals Yosef and Eliyya, the sons of Shelomo ha-Kohen b. Yehosef, who was briefly gaon in 1025 CE.) However, the sender paradoxically thinks that their enemy, ʿEli b. ʿAmram, should succeed Efrayim, precisely because then he will have to pay obeisance to Daniel, and the two camps will be united. The letter's contents are as follows: (1) condolences on the death of Daniel's sister (r1–12); (2) praise and seeking forgiveness for the fight that had had in the house of al-Damsīsī—Goitein understands this to be because the sender had advocated for ʿEli b. ʿAmram, Daniel's enemy (r13–21); (3) ʿEli (""the idiot"") didn't understand that the sender had long been a supporter of Daniel b. ʿAzarya, even before the death of Shelomo b. Yehuda; and anything the sender has done for ʿEli is like what David did for Saul—serving him despite the latter's intention to kill him (r23–36); (4) an explanation of how the sender supported ʿEli b. ʿAmram over the Rav, against the objections of the rest of Daniel's contingent, including Abū Isḥāq (Avraham b. Yiṣḥaq Ibn al-Furāt) (v1–12); (5) ʿEli b. ʿAmram's boorish behavior once he assumed leadership, which alienated the other leading figures of the community (including Abū Sahl al-Kohen, a certain Abū l-Surūr, and a certain Elḥanan), to the point that they boycotted the synagogue  (v12–28); (6) ʿEli, fearing that he would be deposed in favor of the Rav, recruited his son-in-law Ḥunayn and started spreading malicious rumors about the Rav, including something he supposedly said to Ibn al-Talmid involving the latter's mother. Then, ""Ḥunayn went and gathered some potters and quarrelsome people, and hired about fifty of them, and they wrote legal deeds about the Rav, [saying] that he had apostatized (pashaʿa) in al-Shām and [later] arrived in Egypt to re-Judaize (yatahawwada)"" (v29–36). (Information from Goitein's edition. Translation of the last section from Moshe Yagur, ""Several Documents from the Cairo Geniza Concerning Conversion to Islam"" (2020).) (Alan Elbaum) The handwriting on this letter is the same as that of ENA 4020.65, a copy of what Goitein believed to be a petition from Shelomo b. Yehuda to al-Ẓāhir during the rivalry with Yosef al-Sijilmāsī. (Marina Rustow)"

Dated: Monday, 2[7] Kislev 1405 Seleucid, which is 1093 CE. ʿEli b. Yefet Ibn al-Wāsiṭī was summoned to the court of David b. Daniel b. ʿAzarya ha-Nasi (served 1082–94) to clarify the legal status of his daughter Milāḥ. ʿEli, who traveled between Fustat and Ashqelon, affirms that he bought a Nubian female slave named אכתרי (Aktharī? Ukthurī? Akthirī? Ikhtarī?) along with her daughter, in Ashqelon, for domestic service. After the daughter died, ʿEli freed the Nubian woman and married her, under the supervision of the Gaon Eliyya ha-Kohen (who served 1062–83). She subsequently gave birth to Milāḥ, who has now reached puberty. There was concern in Fustat that Milāḥ was actually identical with the original daughter whom ʿEli purchased and who died. ʿEli presents two witnesses from Ashqelon who confirm that the woman had no child when she married ʿEli. They were then asked about the interval of time between the marriage and the birth of Milāḥ, but they did not know. In any case, because Milāḥ was clearly born after the manumission of her mother, the court here acknowledges her as a legitimate Jew and grants her permission to marry whomever she pleases. This is one of the later documents known from David b. Daniel's tenure, and it is one of the handful of documents in which he is titled ""Exilarch"" (Rosh ha-Gola), none of which are earlier than 1092 CE.

Only the left part of the letter is preserved. Apparently, the writer complains that the revenue from ""the compound"" (by which the compound in Fustat dedicated for the Jerusalemites is obviously meant) did not arrive; nor did they receive an additional sum which used to be sent from Fustat for ""the holiday.""

It seemed at first that the newborn would survive (kānat ʿalāmatuhu khayr), but he died soon afterward (r4–6). Shelomo's daughter remains ill with an intermittent fever (r19, where the word ""nawba"" is probably to be understood in its technical sense of ""paroxysm""), however it seems not dangeorusly ill, since Shelomo plans to return to Jerusalem in two days.

1433,Letter,"illness: marad, illness letter 969-1517, polygyny, illness: marital, personal, Anatoli, Illness, Illness: women's","Abū l-Faraj b. Khalaf (?), probably in Minyat Ghamr, writes to his cousin (ibn ʿamma), Eliyyahu the Judge, in Fustat. These cousins had prior correspondence and business dealings—Eliyyahu sent 22 dirhams with his previous letter, and the writer has a store in which he deals in indigo. The purpose of this letter is to ask Eliyyahu to write to the judge R. Menaḥem in the hope of obtaining permission for Abū l-Faraj to take a second wife. Eliyyahu is familiar with the case already, but Abū l-Faraj repeats some of it here. He has endured 20 years of suffering because of the illness of his wife, which prevents her from going to the bath (presumably a problem for him because of menstrual purity laws rather than because of hygiene). When Abū l-Faraj arrived in Minyat Ghamr from Jerusalem, he found a second woman whom he wanted to marry. The local judge, Mufaḍḍal the ḥaver, refused to marry them on his own authority and said that permission would need to come from higher up. Mufaḍḍal sent a letter to R. Menaḥem with Ḥabīb the shohet, but there was no response; Abū l-Faraj himself was unable to accompany Ḥabīb. Abū l-Faraj thought that Eliyyahu would already have intervened on his behalf, but no news of that has reached him. He visited Alexandria, but it seems that Mufaḍḍal discouraged him from seeking a ruling from the judge [A]natoli on account of his strictness. In the remainder of the letter, he repeats his request in various ways. He is willing to come to Fustat in order to marry. Information from Friedman's edition and translation. The writer quotes a saying in lines v13–15, where he is urging Eliyyahu to act quickly, and Friedman marked his translation as somewhat tentative. Cf. alternate versions of the same idiom in ENA 2558.21, T-S 13J21.20, Moss. II,167, T-S Misc.28.33, and Bodl. MS heb. d 66/14, e.g., ""mā baqiya fī l-ʿumr mithla mā maḍā,"" literally, ""there do not remain [years] of life like those which have passed,"" apparently corresponding to the English ""we aren't getting any younger, [so please help me]."" Another version of the phrase also appears in the first chapter of Ibn Buṭlān's Daʿwat al-Aṭibbā', in the mouth of a physician whose income has dried up and who has nowhere to go: mā baqiya aqallu mimmā maḍā (""what remains is less than what has passed"").

When only 17 dirhems came in, the Nagid ordered 13 dirhems taken from a collection for a man from Damira, Egypt, and turned over to that notable.

The record also contains some bigger money matters between the leading officials of the congregation, such as the return to one of them of a sum he had advanced for the needs of the synagogue.

1465,Letter,"illness letter 969-1517, communal, polygyny, illness: children's, Illness, Aguna","Recto: Letter from communal leaders, in Alexandria, to the judge Shemuel, in Fustat. In Judaeo-Arabic. Dating: Unclear; likely early 13th century, based on handwriting and Goitein's identification of the judge Shemuel as the same one mentioned in T-S 10J16.6.  Regarding a woman in Alexandria with a sick daughter, whose husband had fled his creditor and gone to the capital. The letter says that she had been deserted for a long time, that she had to maintain herself and her little girl, to pay rent, and on top of this, was sued in court by the creditor of her husband. The writers of the letter ask in the politest terms that Shemuel approach the Nagid for action in this matter. Verso: Letter from the judge Shemuel to the Nagid. The writer reports that he had sent several summons to the runaway husband, but since both the High Holidays (approx. September) and Hanukka (approx. December) had passed without response from him, sterner measures were now required, and, to the judge's dismay, the Nagid had to be troubled. The matter was of utmost seriousness since the Alexandrian wife asserted that her husband had married another woman and was living with her in Cairo. Clearly, the police now had to be instructed to bring the man to court by force. But only the Nagid, as official representative of the state, was authorized to give that order.

NB: Goitein published this fragment in ""New sources on the Palestinian Gaonate,"" Baron Jubilee Volume (1974), but at the time it was called ""T-S NS 320.16.""

Yaḥyā of Fustat. Greetings are sent to a certain parnas Abū l-Riḍā and to the cantor Abū l-Muʿammar. Dated 1091 CE. 

The second letter is evidently addressed to a priestly scholar in Iraq who was authorized by the exilarch Ḥizqiyya. It appears he had written Evyatar about a widow who had become liable to the levirate as her husband Yefet had died without issue. Evyatar sends greetings in the names of his two sons, Eliyyahu and Sadoq, and the banker Shemuel b. Aharon and the elder Abu ʿAlī Ḥasan are also mentioned, and ""my son-in-law ʿAmram ha-Kohen he-Ḥaver ha-Meʿulle Yesod ha-Yeshiva, of Jerusalem.""

Abu'l-Surur was apparently in the perfume business, and the representatives of the qodesh wished to prevent the qa'a rented by him from being used for anything connected with his occupation. He is therefore absolutely forbidden to arrange for any reservoir of rose water, or to make any breach in the wall, or to use arsenic or any other drugs whose production entails the use of fire. The verso of the document, written five years later by Shemuel b.

The parcel (saha) is in Dammuh, near the synagogue. It had been dedicated to Yesha'yahu ha-Levi b. Misha'el (Maimonides' brother-in-law) who, in a previous document, was appointed general administrator of the qodesh. The lessee is granted the right to build on the land and also to cultivate it and operate the saqiya on it. The lease is for a period of 30 years, for 180 dirhams, i.e. six dirhams a year; it is apparently a small parcel. In 30 years, it will revert to the qodesh. The purpose of the deal, from the point of view of the qodesh, might have been the revival of the Dammuh area, to prevent it from falling into decay. This was a practice known in Egypt during many centuries, taken over by the Muslim administration from the Hellenistic-Roman-Byzantine emphyteusis, meaning lease for a symbolic price, and sometimes exeption from taxes, in order to revitalize abandoned land.

Dating: Summer 1100 CE. The letter deals with the ransoming of Qaraite captives from Jerusalem following the Crusader conquest of the city. (Qaraites represented a large percentage of the small number of Jews who still lived in Jerusalem after the Seljuk conquest[s] in the 1070s.) The letter also explains that the fortified city of Ashqelon had not yet fallen, but the residents are struggling to cope with an influx of refugees and the need to make large payments to the Crusaders to ransom back Jewish captives - men, women and children - as well as books and scrolls pillaged from the synagogues of the Holy Land. Despite the terrible circumstances, they take solace in the fact that that the Crusaders appeared not to have mistreated the women. The writers report that they had received the suftaja (bill of exchange), at least the second substantial donation from the Jews of Fustat to the campaign to redeem captives and books. This letter is a request for further donations. The community in Ashqelon had spent over 500 dinars; ransomed over 40 captives; continues to bear the high expenses of caring for the 20 redeemed captives who remain in Ashqelon; and is now in debt for more than 200 dinars. The writers also mention Jews who had escaped from Jerusalem on their own, and others who had been given safe-conduct with the wālī. Of the refugees who arrived in Ashkelon, many had died of the epidemic they encountered there: ""The attacks of these illnesses (amrāḍ), the falling of that plague (wabā'), that pest (fanā'), that disaster (balā')"" (recto, lines 17–19); later, describing how the refugees perished, ""Some of them arrived here healthy, and the climate turned against them (ikhtalafa ʿalayim al-hawā'), and they arrived at the height of that plague (wa-waṣalū fī ʿunfuwān dhālik al-wabā'), and many of them died"" (recto, lines 42–44); then, twice more, the writers emphasize their great expenses caring for those who have survived but are still sick, who need not only food and clothing but medicines and syrups (recto, lines 53–55 and right margin 19–20). There are notes by the writers and forwarders of the letter in the right margin on verso, including Yehayyahu ha-Kohen b. Maṣliaḥ, David b. Shelomo and Ḥanina b. Manṣūr b. ʿUbayd.

(Information from CUDL.) See also T-S AS 151.160 (PGPID 38103).

Gil summarizes this letter as follows: ""It is therefore not surprising that Natan b. Avraham was anxious to recruit his followers in view of the imminent pilgrimage, as can be seen in his explicit letter to a certain ‘yedid [friend] of the yeshiva’, whose identity and location is not known to us. This letter contains a request to recruit as many supporters for the pilgrimage as possible, as I have already mentioned. We shall see that we have some indications that the pilgrimage and the congregation on Hoshaʿna rabbā on the Mount of Olives was a success (however passing) for Natan b. Avraham. In this letter, there are also further echoes of the flaring of passions. The letters of ‘the friend’ did not reach him, writes Natan, and he suspects that Shelomo b. Yehuda's supporters ('a congregation of hypocrites', Job xv:34) obtain them by deception. Natan b. Avraham appointed people to hold community offices and distributed titles to his followers. For instance, Mevasser b. Yishay is mentioned as ‘head of the communities’ and he is also called ‘faithful of the yeshiva'. This Mevasser visited Ramla and received writings from Natan for his followers. Natan also appointed Avraham b. Shela ḥaver, and he explains in detail how important it is that there should be ‘an ordained man’ in every community, meaning of course, someone loyal to Nathan. According to his statements, he enjoyed notable success in Ramla. The authorities were pressed lest they agreed to the demands of Shelomo b. Yehuda's backers: they even warned the local ruler that they would approach the mishnē, that is, the wazīr. The 'sixth' (it is not clear who this was at that time) went over to Nathan’s side, and even banned one of his rivals. It seems, then, that an optimistic mood prevailed in Natan b. Avraham’s camp in the summer and autumn of 1039 and that he had the upper hand in Ramla. We have no information about the recruiting of supporters for Shelomo b. Yehuda in anticipation of the month of Tishri and the pilgrimage, , but it seems that in his camp, too, there were considerable preparations for the impending events.""

Saʿd chastises Aharon for his absence from his wife and children for 23 years (!). Oded Zinger suggests that Aharon's letter after all that time may have been spurred by a serious illness (ll.22–23) and a desire to gain forgiveness before he died (Zinger, ""Long Distance Marriages in the Cairo Geniza,"" Peʿamim, p. 27). Saʿd then, in response to Aharon's question 'about the water', informs him that 'the Nile has flooded and is at peace' and that the price of bread is an acceptable 12 raṭls for a dirham.

Avraham, in Fustat. In Hebrew. Dating: 1029 CE. ""Here is a description of old age in the hand of Solomon b. Judah Gaon, the president of the Jerusalem yeshiva and official head of the Jews of the Fatimid empire, written nineteen years before his death. The time was excruciating for him: things in the yeshiva and the community at large did not go according to his wishes. Abraham b. Sahlan, a leader of Egyptian Jewry, Solomon's 'peer,' with whom he had probably studied many years before, had just died, and his own son was on his way to Aleppo in northern Syria, a voyage fraught with danger. . . . But old age, like life in general, has its ups and downs: the rich correspondence of the Gaon shows him as being active in affairs and rich in style during the long years following the passage translated above, although a premonition of death is certainly felt in it. 'I am a descending sun, soon to set. My soul is very much depressed since my peer passed away, may he rest in Eden. I ask God only to keep me alive through this year so that people should not say: ""Both died within one year."" Take notice, my dear, that I am going about like a shadow [cf. Psalms 39:7]. I have no authority (reshut), only the title. My strength is gone, my knee is feeble, and my foot staggers. My eyes are dim, and, when I write, it is as if I was learning it, sometimes the lines are straight and sometimes crooked, and so is my style, because my mind is disturbed since the day my beloved [son] traveled to Aleppo to fetch some goods he had left there. I pray to God to bring him back in safety ""before I depart and be no more"" [Psalms 39:14]'"" (Goitein, Med Soc, V, p. 120, translating lines 19–25). "

1639,Letter,"Nahray B. Nissim, trade, 11th c, slave, Marduk b. Musa, Jariya","Letter from Marduk b. Musa in Alexandria to Nahray b. Nissim in Fustat.

From the context, it appears that these 14½ dinars were spent by Marduk b. Musa on behalf of, or at the request of, Nahray b. Nissim. Nahray had made some reference or query in his letter to Marduk concerning the account of the previous year; Marduk replies that he has carefully gone through the letters and account books in his possession and that he still has a favorable balance (even?) after the expenditure of 14½ dinars and a ½ qirat on behalf of Nahray. In checking the accounts, Marduk had recourse to letters (kutub) as well as books of accounts (dafātir). This points to the importance of letters as documents that could serve as a source of obligations and as a repository of information, commitments, instructions, etc. This fact also helps us understand why merchants collected and preserved their business letters. But Marduk adds (r10), ""My lord, we have no need of this latest account of yours, and I have not sought it from you,"" i.e., the account of the previous year's commercial activity had already been settled and agreed upon, and as far as he was concerned, there was no need for Nahray to take the trouble of drafting another promissory note (khaṭṭ) on the matter. Also contains a moving passage in which Mardūk b. Mūsā bares his soul regarding his loneliness since his wife died and the lack of any other adult in the household who can take care of him and his children. He asks Nahray him to find a Jewish slave (jāriya) who is suitable for work, who is reliable and whose chastity can be counted on. (Information from A. L.

Yakhin, a senior colleague in Fustat. Recapitulating previous communication between the two (cf. T-S 13J21.25 written four years earlier), Yehuda notes with frustration that the addressee asked him to send dirges for the deceased, and so he sent him about thirty, and the addressee had replied that he had them all with the exception of two or three. Yehuda advises the addressee to advise him of the first lines of the poems so that there would not be unnecessary duplication (Med Soc V:179, 556.) Almost all of the letter deals with this topic and with the vicissitudes of mail delivery, since many letters both from Yehuda and from Abu l-Majd's brother Abu l-Najm Hilal were either delayed or never arrived at all. Starting on line 16 of verso, Yehuda writes, ""On the night that I wrote this letter, seven great and learned rabbis arrived, and behind them 100 people—men, women, and children—asking for bread. This is apart from the 41(?) beggars we already have in the city [Alexandria], and most of the congregation has been exhausted by poverty.""

Dated: 19 Adar 1538 Seleucid, which is 1227 CE. The letter concerns Rachel's husband, Yosef of Barcelona, who is about to marry a local woman, leaving their children orphans in their lifetimes (and ""pieces of meat""). Eliyyahu is asked to relay her case to the Nagid Avraham Maimonides (1205–37), to intervene and prevent Yosef from doing this to her. Yehuda switches to writing in his own voice on verso, line 3. He sends various respectful greetings and adds that Rachel's eyes (or those of her mother?) have developed ophthalmia (ramad) from all her weeping. The postscript in the hand of (and signed by) the French rabbi Shemuel b. Yaʿaqov corroborates the story in the body of the letter and blames the husband's mother, who tempted him to do these bad things, and also ""his wife, the snake, who married him against his will""—which makes it sound that Yosef has already married the local woman. Shemuel seems to conclude by saying that he has taken on the name ""Kalev"" (or vice versa?) on account of his illness, evidently an effort to change his fortune by changing his name. ASE"

The repairs were agreed upon by the representatives of the qodesh, their urgency having been recognized. Abū l-Faraj Yeshuʿa b.

Ashtor interpreted it incorrectly as (5)164 (AM) = 1404 CE (History of the Jews in Egypt and Syria under the Mamluks, vol. 3, p. 100 n. 2). Goitein corrected Ashtor's reading to 1204 because, as with many other 13th century documents in the geniza, you have to add 4800 to the stated date, so 4964 AM = 1204. To write 4964 in Hebrew, you would have to use a lot of characters, since the alef-bet only covers up until 400. So 4964 would be דתתקסד (that is, 4(000) + 400 + 400 + 100 + 60 + 4). But since in 1204, everyone knew the 4000 + 400 + 400 part, they just omitted it and wrote 164. So the document dates to 1204.

Both would contribute both financial capital and labor. Funds are brought out into a single purse, suggesting that the act of qinyan effected the partnership. Both partners are to engage in trade. The division of profit and loss is not preserved, but line 10 hints that profits and losses were to be divided equally between the two partners. Line 11 affirms the partners' mandate to ""avoid betrayal and indolence and neglect"", suggesting this may have been a long-distance trading partnership. The partners promise ""ethical and honorable"", perhaps because certain norms of behavior are expected of the partners. This does not release the partners from the ""oath of partners"", though, so legal recourse for misappropriation or negligence remains possible.

Reports on the sailing of ships from al-Mahdiyya heading eastward, which must have been among the last departures for the east, since the sailing season ended in mid-September. The letter mentions that the ships that left al-Mahdiyya before the qārib of al-Mufaḍḍal al-Ḥayfī had not yet arrived in Alexandria, either because they were different vessels and travelled at a different speed, or because they took a different course and encountered different weather and wind. The letter mentions three members of the al-Tāhartī family who also travelled in a qārib, that of Ibn al-Manajjā, which left before that of al-Mufaḍḍal al-Hayfī but had not yet arrived. Four members of the al-Tāhartī family were making the journey from al-Mahdiyya to Alexandria in one summer and in ships in the same convoy of ships, which suggests some major, joint, coordinated ventures. The letter is in the distinctive handwriting of Ibrāhīm b. Faraḥ al-Iskandarānī, wakīl al-tujjār, who not only sent letters to Nahray on his own behalf but also served as scribe on behalf of various other merchants who had dealings with Nahray.

In Judaeo-Arabic. Fragment: Bottom half only. Dating: There are reports of men seized for forced labor to dig a ditch around the city. Goitein and Frenkel both suggest that this reference can date the document to 1219 CE, during the fifth crusade. The crusaders besieged Damietta from May 1218 until November 1219 when they finally took it. Evidently, people feared that Alexandria would be next. (See also T-S 16.286, a letter from Alexandria dated 21 October 1219.) This letter reports on the state of the city: ""The city is in a dire state because of the digging of the ditch. The city is locked up, and forced labor is imposed upon the population."" The writer then gives a detailed report about the medical condition and treatment of a woman who had been injured in an unrelated accident, then discusses some small errands, then an important family affair, and concludes with greetings to at least fifteen persons. Two postscripts are added. ""As to Abū l-ʿAlā'—when I arrived, I found the city locked up; no male person could appear in the streets, because he would be taken to the [digging of the] ditch. That's why I was unable to meet him. As to the malḥafa [a blanket serving also as outer garment], the bazaars are locked and no one sells and buys. I am telling you this that you should not think that I am neglectful of your affairs."" Regarding the injury of Yumn: ""When coming home, I found Yumn—on whom the door fell—in a serious condition. She has been ill for forty days. At the time she was impure and remained in that state; thus all the other members of the household became impure together with her. Only God knows how the situation is; she cries so much that I forget my own tribulations. However, if God wills, she has good prospect for recovery. Her leg is in a case (tābūt) especially made for her. A Christian doctor (ʿarel) treats her and I was told that he did not take any money for her treatment. He at that time was treating the wounded (al-majārīḥ). I did not find any bandage (or plaster/dressing) of palm fibers (marham al-nakhlī) in the house and could not move her; for she cannot get up or sit; she bends forward only a little (qad ittajaha qalīl). Her foot and leg are swollen (manfūkh)."" Information and translations from Goitein, Med Soc, V, 56, and note cards #27138–39. This date-palm plaster is recommended for treating wounds and abscesses in the medieval medical literature—a Google search of مرهم نخلي will lead to citations in works by the Andalusians Aḥmad b. ʿIsā al-Hāshimī (d. 1077) and Ibn Zuhr (d. 1162). For Ibn Zuhr, its consistency is like that of honey, and threads are dipped in it before being used to wick fluid out of a wound. Thus, perhaps it is a substance deriving from the date itself, rather than from the palm-fibers. The solution might also be found in Yevr.-Arab. I 1700.22, recto, text block c (PGPID 2724), which may be a recipe for מרהם נכלי. Note also that ""ittajaha"" in the context of injury or illness most often means ""improved"" (rather than ""bend""), and sick people are often described as ""having improved a little"" even if they are still in critical condition.

This letter says it was written on the day after Yom Kippur.

2084,Letter,"Nahray B. Nissim, trade, 11th c, ship, Shipwreck, qunbar, qarib, khiti, Ibn al-Ba'ba'","Letter from Musa b. Abi al-Hayy in Alexandria to Abu Yahya Nahray b. Nissim in Fustat. Dating: ca. 1057 (Gil). This is one of two letters describing a catastrophic set of shipwrecks; the other is CUL Or. 1080 J167 (PGPID 2259). Musa b. Abi al-Hayy is upset by the news of shipwrecks that had befallen some of the ships in which some of the traders from their circle (aṣḥābunā) had sailed with their merchandise. The first group of ships included: (1) the qunbār of the amīr, on which R. Maṣliaḥ, his brother, and Maymūn were sailing; (2) the ship of Ibn al-Baʿbāʿ, on which Isḥaq b. Khalaf, Tamām, and Musa's brother were sailing; (3) the qārib of the amīr headed to Tripoli, on which Khalfon, Ibn Nissim, Ḥajjāj, Shaʾul the son of Ibn Benayya's sister, Janūn, the son of the brother of Ibn al-Iskandarānī; (4) the qārib of the vizier, on which none of their aṣḥāb were traveling; (5) the qārib of al-Tarājima, which likewise contained none of their aṣḥāb; (6) the khīṭī captained by al-Dawwāma, also containing none of their aṣḥāb; (7) the khayṭī of al-Labāʾa, which was headed for Sfax and likewise contained none of the aṣḥāb; (8) the qārib of Ibn Zanbāj. In the second group of ships, the ships included (1) the qārib of Ibn al-Iskandar, on which Mardūk was traveling; (2) the qārib of Ibn Dayṣūr, on which the Kohen Ibn Hārūn and his boy were traveling; (3) the government ship (markab al-sulṭān) on which the son of Abū Yūsuf and Ibn Naḥum were traveling; (4) the qārib of al-Fāriqī, on which Abū Yūsuf, Ibn Raynāʾ, and an ailing man from Gabès (Qābis) were traveling; (5) the Ishfīlī, on which the son of the sister of Abū Ibrāhīm, Ṣemaḥ, Ḥānnān (!) and Ibn Asad were traveling; (6) the qārib of al-Jannānī, which wasn't carrying any of their aṣḥāb. This is not an exhaustive accounting of what's in the letter; also mentioned are the ship of al-Muʿizz, which was carrying the son of Abū Yūsuf, who perished, may God have mercy on him. There were other deaths, and still other people about whom the writer doesn't know whether or not they were saved. Goitein on this pair of letters (Med. Soc., 1:331) ""What could happen to such a convoy is vividly described in two complementary letters, written in Alexandria around the middle of the eleventh century. Altogether, twenty-two ships are mentioned by name and the fate of each is recorded. In addition, the names of the business friends of the addressee, a total of twenty-five, traveling in them and what happened to each are reported. The convoy set sail in three successive groups, called 'sailings' (iqlāʿāt), the first two consisting of eight bottoms each. The first group consisted of a qunbār and a barge of the amir, or governor, of Alexandria; three other barges, one belonging to a vizier, two khīṭīs, one entitled ""al-Ra'isa,"" ""the Chief,"" owned by a lady [Gil reads this differently above, and Rustow concurs with him], and a craft called markab, the general word for ship. The second group consisted of the ship of the sultan Muʿizz of Tunisia, a ship and a barge belonging to a man from Seville, Spain, and several other craft among them one qunbar (as in the first group). These ships sailed on Monday before Pentecost (month of May), but two days later were overcome by a storm, in which the ship of the sultan and another boat perished; the writer of our letters and the addressee both had goods and friends in those ships. The convoy took refuge in two anchoring places on the North African coast, one of which, (Ra's) al-Kanāʾis, is frequently mentioned in our records and is still operating today as a local harbor. (The late King Faruk had a summer palace there, and since Ra's al-Kanaʾis means 'Cape of the Churches,' he renamed it Ra's al-Ḥikma, 'Cape of Wisdom.') Only five ships belonging to the first group succeeded in passing out into the high seas, for in addition to the storm just mentioned, there was another calamity. The enemy, certainly the Byzantine navy, 'which had complete mastery over the sea,' captured one boat and only because of its being busy with it did the rest of the convoy escape. The remaining ships had to return to Alexandria, however, where the governor ordered them to be unloaded, obviously because he did not see any possibility of sending out a second convoy."""

They have to do with properties owned by the Zawbaʿa (""Tempest"") family. The elder brother was named ʿUthmān b. Yefet. The second brother was Maṣliaḥ b. Yefet known as ha-Gizbar (""the Treasurer""), i.e., he was a government officer. (This Maṣliaḥ is also known from Megillat Evyatar as the man who brought up David b. Daniel b. ʿAzarya.) There were two tyrannical governors in Damascus: Ḥaydara Ibn Manzū (r.1063–64) and Muʿallā Ibn Manzū (r.1068–69). One of these expropriated the property of Maṣliaḥ in the Dār Quzmān neighborhood (near the eastern gate of Damascus, in the Jewish quarter), and the two brothers Maṣliaḥ and ʿUthmān fled the city for Egypt. Some 25 years later, Yefet the son of Maṣliaḥ returned to his birthplace and sued to regain the property abandoned by his father and uncle. In the meantime, another uncle had moved into one of the houses, encroaching beyond the border of the neighboring property owned by his wife. The uncle insisted on bringing the case to the Muslim courts, and Yefet b. Maṣliaḥ here testifies that he was compelled to go to the Muslim courts and did not want to.

Ṭoviyya claimed that he sent the amount in various commodities (15 pounds of silk worth 15 dirhams, and fragrances worth 15 dinars, in addition to kābulī murabbā (preserve of chebulic myrobalan), as well as 10 dinars in cash) by means of the agent Abū al-Faraj to be sold in Tunisia. It is unclear whether the 65 dinars is a partnership account or a debt owed Netanel by Ṭoviyya. However, that the commodities were sent to be sold in Tunisia (see T-S 8J4.9) suggests that Ṭoviyya has a financial interest in the sale. Depositing the funds with Abū al-Faraj, Netanel and Ṭoviyya have contracted a partnership of sorts for repayment of Ṭoviyya's debt.

The Rabbanite communal leaders of Fustat attempted to settle the sister’s case preemptively by offering her the same inheritance she would have received in an Islamic court. Begins in the middle of the elders’ admonitions to the girl (Mubaaraka) not to seek redress in an Islamic court. Meanwhile, the military police of the Fatimids (rijjaala) took Mubaaraka’s brother to the qaadii to have him surrender her share, “and she mocked him,” or perhaps gloated over his defeat (the wording is unclear). “She, for her part, is standing by her word and in her audacity is demanding her father’s inheritance from her brother in a gentile court,” it continues. “She has roughly five men supporting her, and they are hardly God-fearing. What we know of the matter we have written in our testimony in order to bring him [her brother] to [justice in] the majlis of our lord, head of the academy, may his Rock sustain him, to do what will bring him closer to his Rock.” And thus they ordered Mubaaraka’s brother to be remanded to the court of Yoshiyahu b.

His wife consents for him to take a second wife and to even take two more wives after her (for a total of 4). Friedman deduces that the year is probably 1291 or 1292, because David Maimonides was in exile in ʿAkko from his enemies in Egypt from approximately 1285–89, and the Muslim conquest of ʿAkko from the Crusaders in 1291 is a likely occasion for a Jewish woman to have been taken captive and need to be redeemed. The Nagid David, back in Cairo, could have presided over this legal case due to his connections to the remaining Jewish community in ʿAkko.

The apartment is in Dar al-Zajjaj, one of the compounds owned by the qodesh. The lessee is himself a parnas. The tabaqa is described as the apartment, sukn, of Makarim Ibn Sahlan. In fact, this must be understood as Makarim and Ibn Sahlan, since they are listed separately in accounts of rent, where they pay five dirhams a month each, the same sum of rent that Abu'l-Fadl, the new tenant, will have to pay. Abu'l-Bayan, the representative of the qodesh, cannot be one of the parties in the concluding formula which says ""from each of the two,"" since he represents the court. The most plausible explanation is that the two tenants rented the tabaqa of the qodesh inhabited by them, to a third party, with the knowlesge and active participation of the qodesh.

2264,Letter,"condolence, David I Maimonides","Letter(s) sent from Qūṣ to Fustat. Sender and addressee (called only Sayyidnā) remain unidentified. Two fragments, with another piece still missing in between them (if they are a join). In Judaeo-Arabic. Opens with eloquent blessings for the addressee, including a citation of Joshua 1:5. The sender reports that the addressee's letter finally arrived in Qūṣ 50 days after it was sent. From that letter, he learned about what happened to Abū l-Ṭāhir b. Nānū, perhaps the death of a son. In the lower fragment, he conveys condolences for two different people he calls Sayyidnā (one has multiple children and one has one son; one of them is presumably the addressee himself). In a postscript, he asks the addressee to convey his condolences to the Nagid David I Maimonides (active ca. 1237–1300), and to his brother, and to Rabbenu Ḥayyim. (Both the Nagid and Ḥayyim are also called Sayyidnā.) See Goitein's article and his edition of the lower fragment for a discussion of who the deceased might be. The fact that both the Nagid David and R. Ḥayyim receive condolences for the same individual suggests that they might have been in-laws. There might also be multiple bereavements. (Information in part from Goitein's attached notes.) Likely join: Alan Elbaum. NB: the join is not certain because it is not continuous; Amir Ashur and M. A. Friedman suspect that these are actually two different letters of condolence written by the same scribe, CUL Or.1080 J70 the upper part of a letter and CUL Or.1080 J179 the lower part of a different letter. The crease marks do show that the two pieces were folded up in different ways. The scribe may be the same as in T-S 18J4.7 (PGPID 8127), ENA 2727.26 (PGPID 11970) (where we learn his name Mufaḍḍal b.

Initially described as commenda (qirāḍ) but re-negotiated into a loan with a fixed rate of interest at 20 dirhams on the 36 dinars of capital. Emerged both from Jewish and Islamic courts. The renegotiation is because of Abraham's failure as the active partner in the qirāḍ: under pressure from Amram in the Islamic courts, he deeds his house to Amram for the value of 36 dinars. This sale is confirmed in the Jewish courts with a codicil that Avraham can redeem the house by repaying the loan (which has an initial term of four years) within 12 years. Avraham had given Amram promissory notes prior to this sale, produced in Jewish and Islamic courts. Following the debt restructuring, a ban placed on Avraham (likely in some earlier document) by the judge Peraḥya is lifted.

The creditor, Abū l-Riḍā ha-Shomer (the guard), loaned funds to the partnership as a corporation but not to the partners as individuals. Although the two partners contracted to work the same amount and to share profits and losses equally, the partnership lacks sufficient funds to repay the loan. Abū l-Riḍā asks the partners to demand the “oath of partners” each from the other, and himself demands that each pay half the loss, but one of the partners (Hiba) seems reluctant for unclear reasons. Pressured by Hiba's refusal to pay his share of the debt, the other partner (Mūsā b. Bishr, who appears also in ENA 4011.55) brings Hiba to court. The result of the court’s action was mediation (“tawassaṭū”), and Hiba agreed to pay Mūsā a single dinar, to which the latter would add the balance of three dinars.

On verso there is a legal record (written after the divorce) certifying that ʿAmāʾim has received the 5 dinars of the delayed marriage payment “specified in this ketubba.” This interpretation is tentative owing to the state of the document and the fact that Goitein seems to have understood the payment as maintenance for nursing/rearing a child for 5 months. (But note also that the poor state of the previous PGP transcription suggests that the fragment was even more crumpled when Goitein examined it than it is now.)

Abū al-Faraj gives Hillel 100 dirhams as an absolute debt and the latter agrees to work until the amount is repaid. If Hillel wishes to leave this employment, he must pay the entire balance of the debt. It seems that Abū al-Faraj is also to pay Hillel a wage, though the amount is unspecified. Repayment of the debt is to be recorded on the document itself. Abū al-Faraj is referred to as ""his teacher"", though his trade is not clear from the document; he is simply called ""the [government] employee"".

The document doesn't use the formal terms shirka or mu‘āmala to describe their relationship, but the parties attest to ""having partnered"" in the shop. Both partners seem to work in the operation, profits and losses are generally to be split equally, and weekly maintenance is specified for each party. Manṣūr seems to be the senior partner; he brings more assets to the partnership, and the facility itself may belong to him, as he is allocated 4 dirhams of rent for the shop each month. However, income from the sale of scent sachets was allocated to Faḍā’il, who may have produced these alone without Manṣūr's assistance. Written and signed by Yehuda b.

This document contains a partial court record of a partnership between Yefet b. Wad‘a and Abū Zikrī. While Abū Zikrī was away travelling, Yefet invited Sa‘āda to join the partnership, for which Sa‘āda was to be paid 1.5 dirhams each day. Sa‘āda purchased henna for the partnership, and he called the court to validate his testimony that the value of  the henna had dropped. As Yefet both invited Sa‘āda to the partnership in the absence of Abū Zikrī and agreed to pay him a daily wage, he appears to have been either the senior partner or a passive investor, while Abū Zikrī and Sa‘āda are active partners. Given that Yefet has invited Sa‘āda to join the extant partnership (instead of contracting a new partnership with Sa‘āda) Yefet and Abū Zikrī likely both had capital investments in the intial partnership, and Yefet had the task of investing the joint capital while Abū Zikrī pursued other trading opportunities. Unusually, the agreement between Sa‘āda and the other two partners required him to take an oath attesting to partnership accounts should the partnership assets lose value. The remainder of the document (lines 8-28) is a draft of a marriage agreement of a couple who were divorced in Tyre and subsequently reconciled in al-Mahalla. It provides specifics as to the dowry (including money, textiles and clothing, a drinking cup, and a mirror) but lacks the names of the relevant parties.

""I am at this time exhausted (or muddled, multāth), confused and doubtful. By my father, I don't know what I'm writing because my mind is preoccupied. May the end be good, God willing"" (r15–16). Labrāṭ congratulates on his brother on his marriage to a woman from a notable family in Fustat. He asks his brother to convey congratulations to Abū l-Khayr, the new brother-in-law, ""because I have no heart and no mind,"" i.e., Labrāṭ is too depressed to write himself (r30–36). He uses the same excuse for his failure to maintain his correspondence with ""al-rav al-ajall,"" the most exalted teacher (v5). ""I write these lines overcome by tears"" due to his separation from his brother and lack of close confidants in Sūsa (r36–37). Labrāṭ plans to travel soon, whether to east or to west.

2451,Legal document,11th c,"Legal testimony. Location: Fustat. Dated: 1070 CE. Regarding the collection of a debt owed by Hillel b. Menashshe to the judge Avraham b. Natan. After a number of court sessions an agreement was reached, but Avraham was unable to collect the balance of the debt due to travel. He sent his uncle Ṣedaqa b. Mevorakh to collect the remainder of the debt, part of which has already been collected. The parties may have disagreed about the remaining amount of the debt because some of it was equity in one or more joint enterprise (kull mu‘āmala), initiated by Natan (Avraham’s father). It fell to Hillel to repay this debt, and a penalty clause is included should he fail to repay, indicating that Ṣedaqa didn't actually collect the total, but a portion plus an assurance of the remainder. Once Ṣedaqa collected payment from Hillel, the latter was cleared of further obligations. The missing portion of the document likely specified the amount of this payment, as well as containing the closing formulae and the witnesses’ signatures.

The cause of the dispute may have been a disagreement over valuation of partnership assets, or over the terms of the partnership itself. Lieberman notes that if Avraham’s business relationships with Hillel had spanned a number of partnerships, then the disagreement could have been about the division of partnership profits (rather than the value of these profits). Abraham held a debt document (kitāb dayn), suggesting that the terms of an initial loan to Hillel and perhaps the terms of the mu‘āmala itself were laid out, in which case the dispute could be over the valuation of partnership assets.

Yedutun had to swear to Abū Zikrī that he must have been mistaken about seeing Moshe in Cairo and that Moshe doesn't know Ben Shaʿya either.

2511,Legal document,"12th c, silk, Minyat Ashna, loan, Partnership, Malij, orphans, trust","Legal document. Partnership agreement. Dated: 1151. Location: Minyat Ashna (near Fustat). Following appeals by his deceased brother Binyam's widow to the court, Kathīr b. Avraham takes over the maintenance (1 dinar a month, an aboslute requirement) of his sister-in-law's orphaned children as a sort of partnership. The sources of this funding are a) rent revenue from shops in Malij left to the children by Binyam and b), the profit earned by Kathīr from 20 dinars’ worth of silk from estate of Binyam. Unusually, the ""partnership"" profits are not split according to a fixed percentage, but rather the children, as the ""silent partner"", receive a fixed amount each month. This is effectively a long-term loan or trust created under the structure of a partnership agreement.

Per Goitein, Shemuel b. Yehuda ibn Asad, previous caretaker of the orphans, was apparently a regular caretaker and trustee for orphans; see PGPID 2658. Shemuel is the same Abū al-Ma‘ālī in PGPID 6581. (Information from Lieberman, ""A Partnership Culture"", pp. 7-10)"

He was then able to sell the property for 300 dinars. The uncle of the orphans bore the title Raḍiyy al-Dawla (""Pleasing the Government""), and the father of their guardian was a kātib, or government official. Signed by Shemuel b.

Location: Fustat. Dated: 1134. Abū Sa‘d and Abū Sahl form a partnership lasting 6.5 months to manufacture and sell glass. Half the capital (20 dinars in total) invested by Abū Sa‘d is considered a loan to Abū Sahl, who pledges title to his home as a security. This may suggest diversion from the commenda model, where the active partner is not liable for loss. But the partnership also diverges from the ‘eseq model, wherein only the active partner transacts. Both the profit/loss characteristics and the working arrangement between the partners suggests a craft partnership.

Abū Sa‘d is likely the senior partner: he is identified as al-Zajjāj, “the glazier” (i.e., a known personage in the field), while Abū Sahl is given no professional designation; as well, Abū Sa‘d invests all of the capital, suggesting that he may be short of liquid assets). Finally, the partnership stipulates that Abū Sa‘d need only work two shifts a week (suggesting he may have other business elsewhere), while Abū Sahl will work the rest of the week.

Mentioned in Rustow, ""Formal and Informal Patronage,"" Al-Qantara (2008), p. 363. [Goitein's identifications here are not completely certain. The individuals named and the content support the identification with Abu Zikri. It is not his usual handwriting, so Goitein suggests that he dictated it. Judge Eliyyahu's wife in other documents was Sitt Rayḥān. Abu Zikri's younger brother Abu l-Barakat Shelomo was married for a time to a woman named Sitt Ghazal. If Abu Zikri is the writer, could he be writing to Shelomo's wife intead (""the mother,"" not ""my mother"")? It seems that Shelomo is currently with him (lines 19-21), so he couldn't have directed this request to Shelomo. And he opens, ""God give you joy with the precious boy, the master, the brother"" (line 5), consistent with a letter to a sister-in-law. ASE.]"

The writer sends thanks for the forwarding of a prescription from one physician, Abū l-Bahā', and reminds Natan to obtain a second prescription from another physician, al-Amīn, both for his sick wife. The latter physician was perhaps a Muslim or Christian, since the addressee is asked to transcribe the prescription from Arabic to Hebrew (but cf. T-S 8J16.19 + T-S NS 323.13, in which a Jew is asked not to use Arabic script). ""Favor your servant with the answer to be given by my lord al-Amīn, may his reward be doubled.

Owing to her grave sufferings (min ʿuẓm al-alam) her menses (al-ṭamth) have stopped. Finally, because of her great anxiety (min kuthrat al-takarrub), she is affected by mild palpitation (rajīf yasīr) of the heart.""

It is also possible that the phrase ""knee pain"" (wajaʿ rukab) should be read ""pelvic pain"" (wajaʿ rakab), especially as the next sentence describes the menstrual changes brought on by excessive pain.

The ṣāḥib al-dīwān lives now in the neighborhing house and walks over the roofs and knows what is going on—particularly that there is plenty of space for soldiers in the house. The sister, who possibly had a part in the house, should come. Information from Goitein's note card and Med Soc, IV, p. 24. The letter was dictated to Ibrāhīm (the writer's father?) and addressed to Abū l-Ḥasan b. Ibrāhīm al-Ṣā'igh in the market of the goldsmiths in Fusṭāṭ. The first part of the letter is a rebuke for the addressee's silence. ""We could all die, and still you would not ask after us. We hear news of you only from hearsay. If it were not for my pregnancy, I would have traveled [to Fusṭāṭ] to ask after you, because I am tired of sending letters without receiving responses. You now write to tell me, 'Come to us,' because my maternal aunt has died. You did not even write to tell me that you were sick [as well]. Even if I were your enemy, that much at least you would owe me. My cousin died, and you did not even write to console me or your paternal uncle. . . What is the solution to (or reason for?) this enmity? Please come and visit, for the house is derelict and empty. We fear the billeting—for the ṣāḥib al-dīwān lives next door in the house of Yūsuf and walks over the roofs—and that the Ghuzz will take it, and we will not be able to say anything. Even Ibn al-Sarūjī sold his house because of the Ghuzz."" On verso: ""By God, my sister, console the daughter of my maternal aunt on my behalf. I was sick and was unable to write to her to console her about her mother. As soon as you see this letter, send its response and whatever you see fit with whomever will deliver it. I will pay for it. All of my children have fallen sick, and the female slave is also sick, may God make the end good. By God, I do not need to urge you to send the response quickly, for my eyes are on the road and on every person who arrives. When I hear you are healthy, I will rejoice. I have taken a vow not to break my fast during the day until your letter arrives. I have perished from fasting. Perhaps you will come in place of your letter, and look into what you will do with your [share in the house?]. For Ibn Hilāl is not waiting for Ibn al-Qāḍī to arrive. He has already sent and made me take a vow regarding you. . . ."" She concludes with sending regards to Abū l-Ḥasan and his siblings and his son, and to Ibrāhīm. ASE."

When Zeraḥ and Amaṣya originally imported the cheese, they brought with them letters/documents bearing the signatures of the elders of Crete, which were recognized as valid in Alexandria.

Mūsā of Sfax, in Mazar, Sicily, to his partner Yehuda b. Moshe b. Sughmār, in Fustat. In Judaeo-Arabic. The longest letter in the Geniza. Dating: Early 1060s according to Ben-Sasson, based on the military disruptions mentioned. 7 September 1064 according to Gil, based on his identification of the battle discussed as that between the Qā'id of Sfax and the Zīrid ruler Tamīm b. Muʿizz on that date. Many details about a wide variety of commodities are mentioned, as well as financial transactions. ""In essence, this long letter had a single purpose: to convince Yehuda b. Sughmār, Salāma's partner, not to dissolve the relationship between them."" Salāma in fact agrees to the dissolution of the formal partnership (ṣuḥba), ""I got your letters this year, and you swore that you wanted to dissolve. I want this to happen even more than you do. If the partnership continues there will be discord. . . . Now we no longer feel as we used to, when we relied on each other"" (v4–5, 30). Despite this, Salāma suggests other ways of continuing their relationship, including Yehuda's mentoring of Nissim, a new junior associate Salāma is sending to him, and Yehuda's sending Salāma some goods in agency. Jessica Goldberg, Trade and Institutions, pp. 296–99 (""Salāma b. Mūsā's Disastrous Year""). Salāma opens with his shock and dismay at the letters full of blame that he had received from Yehuda. ""I had expected you to congratulate me on my survival in al-Mahdiyya, my deliverance from destruction, and the terrible ordeal (al-mawqif al-ʿaẓīm, also mentioned in r23) that I would not wish on anyone. I was bound (kutiftu) and almost killed (or executed, ʿuriḍtu ʿalā l-sayf) four times (or five—the ink is flaked here). Even if there were no partnership (sharika), love, (mawadda), or association (ṣuḥba) between us, this would have been incumbent on you. Now, more than one year later, the terror has not subsided, rather the fright remains in my heart. My greatest trial in al-Mahdiyya was my concern for your business. . . ."" Interestingly, when Salāma mentions Yehuda's illnesses of last year (mā laḥaqak tilk al-sana min al-ḍuʿf wa-l-tawajjuʿ, r75), there is not a word of the usual sympathy or congratulations on his recovery. Gil understands Halper 414 to be a follow-up from this letter; Goldberg believes that Halper 414, a small sheet, was inserted into Halper 389, which seems to agree with Goitein, who calls it a ""continuation"" of Halper 389 (see Goitein notes linked to PGPID 35364).

The divison of losses is not clear due to the manuscript's deterioration. While Udovitch (1970, pg. 239) suggests that the fact that the active partner in a qiraḍ bears no liability for loss is ideal for long distance trade, the partners in this agreement seem to plan to travel and still use the Talmudic model rather than the qirāḍ.

However, the level of detail which is included suggests that this was not simply the page out of a formulary work. The partnership may have been an apprenticeship since only one of the partners is described as bringing assets to the partnership, the distribution of profits is not even between the partners but rather grants one partner two-thirds of the profit despite the fact that both partners are active in trading, and the partnership itself is to last “a number of years”. Lines 14-15 read “And if So-and-So requests [this] of us, we will affix our signature”, suggesting that perhaps sometimes partnership agreements were formed without witnesse.

Abu l-Majd fell sick with unnamed illnesses after his departure.

However, the final letter of the word that Goitein read as דעא cannot be an aleph, and the first letter is closer to Abu l-Majd's distinctive כ than his ד. The best fit may be אלכפץ. Moreover, the word לאכתי fits the context better if it is read לאנני. Thus, a more likely reading seems to be, ""I was delayed in going down below (to see you off) because I was unwell....""

2728,Legal document,"register, Qaraites, to edit, adultery, rashomon, harassment","Legal report in a Qaraite court register. Written in Judaeo-Arabic. Location: Cairo. Dating: Unknown. Catalogued as 1101 CE, but this date does not appear on the microfilm images. Perhaps the missing digits were legible in the past or remain legible on the physical document. The date in the microfilm reads ""Sunday night, 7 Tevet, 14[..] Seleucid."" The digits את appear at the beginning of the year, but this gives only an earliest possible date of 1089 CE and a latest possible date of 1688 CE. Based solely on the script, a date in the 13th century seems more likely. The scribe has the unusual name Neḥam'el b. Mevorakh b. Yehuda b. Aharon. The document is a fascinating report on the Qaraite court of Cairo's investigation into the years-long rumors about the relationship between Abū Naṣr b. Qayūma and an unnamed woman who is alternately referred to as ""the daughter of Abū l-Maʿālī b. Tāmār,"" ""the wife of Abū Saʿd b. Ṣadaqa al-Labbān,"" and ""the woman."" It appears that the woman had a petition (ruqʿa) written on her behalf to the communal authorities, which came into the possession of the scribe, who subsequently brought it to the attention of the Qaraite authority, ha-Nasi ha-Gadol, who called for an inquiry. The council first summoned the woman and her husband (called her ""waliyy"" or ""guardian""). (1) She reported that Abū Naṣr had been stalking her for years, visiting her house three or four times a day. She was frightened of him and told her husband's paternal aunt that if she ever saw Abū Naṣr visit when this woman was alone, she should come down and join them. She had gone several times to the court to complain about him, but nothing came of that. When asked whether she knew who wrote the petition (ruqʿa), she admitted that in fact she was the one responsible for it, but the person who wrote it for her added some things she had not said and left out other things she had said. (2) As for the husband, he responded that he didn't know anything about this. All he knew was that his wife hated to have Abū Naṣr in their house, but he never knew why. (3) Abū Nāsr was then summoned. He denied everything. But then he admitted that he had previously been summoned to court and been issued a restraining order not to enter her house for a period of a year and a half. They questioned him repeatedly, but he wouldn't admit anything else. (4) The woman was then questioned in Abū Naṣr's presence what she had said in his absence, and she was unwilling to repeat what she said before. Rather, ""she changed her story. . . and said, 'I hated. . .'"" (5) Abū l-Faraj al-Ṭaḥḥān reported to the court and attested that whenever he visited the house of his brother-in-law Abū Saʿd b. Ṣadaqa al-Labbān and Abū Naṣr b. Qayūma was also present, he witnessed Abū Naṣr's vulgar speech and behavior toward the woman, but he had no knowledge of whether anything else passed between them. (6) A number of other women were then questioned. They confirmed that the woman under investigation had complained to them numerous times about Abū Naṣr's harassment (taʿarruḍ) of her. However, the scribe writes, because their testimony entirely derived from what the woman herself told them, there is no need to record it in this document. But he notes that these women confirmed her ""agitation"" (imtiʿāḍ) whenever she talked about Abū Naṣr's behavior to them. At this point the court determined that they needed to gather more testimony. Thus they agreed that the next day a ban of excommunication would be declared against anyone who had knowledge of the affair and did not come forward to testify about it. The scribe records the date and his name, and several witnesses sign: Netan'el ha-Kohen b. ʿAmram; Yefet ha-Melammed b. Ḥalfon(?), Avraham b. Yefet, and probably others that are now faded. He adds an addendum the following day stating that he attended ""al-majliṣ al-marsūm"" (Goitein interprets this as 'the next prayer service') of the Qaraites in Cairo and declared the agreed-upon ban of excommunication, effective for a period of one week.

2734,Legal document,"Halfon b. Menashshe, inheritance, Partnership","Legal notes in the hand of Ḥalfon b. Menashshe (Date: 1100-1138). Partnership record. Seʿadya b. Menashshe ha-Kohen has inherited funds from his father, and places 26 dinars with his maternal uncle Abū Isḥāq Avraham b. Efrayim, who will travel with the funds and remit 11/24 of the profit to Seʿadya’s mother. Avraham’s report of partnership profits is not notarized. The only condition is that Avraham may not invest or lend out the funds to anyone except someone called “Barhun”. Losses are to be split evenly; as the active partner, Avraham is entitled to a larger share of the profits than that for which he would be liable in terms of losses, per Maimonidean criteria (even though the difference between Avraham’s share in the profit and his share in the loss is only 1/24 of the total profit). Per Maimonides, the partners have the flexibility to create such a profit and loss sharing agreement only if they have multiple concurrent business relationships; otherwise the percentage of profits allocated to the active partner must exceed the percentage of losses by at least 1/6 of the total profit, in which case Avraham would have been allocated no less than 2/3 of the profit (since he is to share losses equally with Seʿadya).

2744,Legal document,"pharmacy, debt, Partnership","Verso: Legal document. Partnership agreement. Dating: Late 13th century CE according to Lieberman, but in fact probably closer to 1230 CE (the date of recto). Location: Fustat. The scholar (ha-talmid) Moshe b. Ṭahor partners with Abū Saʿd b. Abū l-ʿAlā al-Ṣabbāgh in an apothecary shop. Moshe is paid 6 dirhams a month agrees to work for a year and a half. His wage is guaranteed by Abū Saʿd’s father Abū l-ʿAlāʾ (ll.7-8). Because of the guarantee of Abū al-ʿAlāʾ, three qinyanim are performed: Moshe's agreement to work, Abū Saʿd’s agreement to pay, and the guarantee of Abū l-ʿAlāʾ’. Although the parties’ relationship is described as a partnership, Moshe's wages being fixed suggests an employment agreement, though likely not an apprenticeship, both because Moshe is not a youth (line 5 alludes to his five sons) and is said to manage or set up the store. The date and signatures are missing from the document in its current state of preservation, though T-S NS J405 (PGPID 26473) reveals Abū Saʿd agreeing to repay a debt of some eight hundred dirhams from November 1275. Perhaps Abū Saʿd had come upon difficult times and needed the guarantee of his father in order to convince Moshe to manage the apothecary shop. Note: Abū al-ʿAlāʾ's guarantee is for fulfillment of the obligation “to the store”, suggesting a sense of corporate identity ascribed to the store and its creditors.

Ibrahīm, in Fustat, to his father Abū Isḥāq Ibrahīm b. Shabbetay (aka Shubbāṭ), in Palermo. Fragment: upper part of the letter only. In Judaeo-Arabic, with the address in both Judaeo-Arabic and Arabic. Dating: Early 11th century, by Gil's estimate. He suggests that this family may be connected to Benei Sunbāṭ, the family of Sahlān b. Avraham. Contents: Shemuel conveys everyone's worry on account of the addressee, as they have received no news ever since the father's departure from Alexandria. Shemuel then conveys the news of his sister al-Turfa, who is very ill. ""She came down with a terrible illness (wajaʿ) at the beginning of Marḥeshvan, which lasted two months, and the illness culminated in a stomach abscess (? dhubayla ʿalā raʾs fuʾādhā). There was not a doctor in Fustat that we did not bring to see her or a single medicine or syrup that we did not give her to drink. After this, terrible fainting fits (ghashw, probably = ghashwa) came over her. We asked her, having despaired of her, saying, ""What do you want? What do you desire?"" And she said, crying, ""By God, there is no desire (shahwa) in my heart and no........ [the fragment ends here]."" Gil suggests that her statement should be connected to the writer's expression of longing for the father, something like, ""there is no desire in my heart except to see you."" (Information in part from Mediterranean Society, I, pp. 304, 476; III, pp. 241, 479,and Goitein's index cards.) The significance of 'dhubayla' is ambiguous not only here but also in the medieval Islamic medical literature: see the thorough discussion in Alvarez-Millan, “Disease in Tenth-Century Iran and Irak according to al-Razi’s Casebook”, Suhayl 14 (2015), pp. 69f. Also ambiguous is whether 'raʾs al-fuʾād' refers to the stomach or rather to the skin overlying the heart (as it does in al-Razi's casebook). See CUL Or.1080 J24 for another account of a woman with a prolonged illness who developed fainting fits (ghashawāt). See also T-S AS 183.135 for a medical treatise discussing 'dhubayla' and its treatment. It is faded and difficult to read but does mention the stomach (al-miʿda). ASE."

She expresses the anxiety (nār) that afflicts her heart on his behalf ever since his departure on Friday. She has been having nightmares and insomnia, and fears that if he does not return quickly, she will be completely blind by the time he returns. (It is also possible that the phrase ""yatlaf baṣarī"" refers to death instead of going blind; compare ""wafāt ʿaynak"" in T-S 10J12.14.) She urges him not to drink wine ""on account of your illness. . . May God protect us from illness while separated (al-maraḍ fī l-ghurba). . . If my night visions are distressing to me, how [much the worse] if I should see them while awake.""

The scribe Abū Manṣūr interjects here (line 13), and the remainder of the letter is in his voice. He apologizes for troubling the addressee with news of illness, but the fever is still with him. He asks for news of Abū l-Waḥsh Sibāʿ, and the bible, and the book of Rabbenu Baḥye. He is very anxious to learn what his instructions are—it seems he is to copy one or both of these books for Abū l-Waḥsh—so that he is not accused of tardiness.

Abū ʿImrān, probably in Fustat, who shared living quarters with him (?), complaining that a Christian physician is ruining his livelihood, writing: 'he behaves like a charlatan.' The letter also touches on several small business matters. The letter starts with two biblical quotations (line 2, Prov. 3:26, line 3, Dt. 7:15). (Information from Mediterranean Society, III, pp. 164, 462, Goitein's index cards, and CUDL.) Further interesting elements: The writer is upset about the lack of letters (""is this anger? why this great hostility?""). He supplies the addressee with a potential excuse by saying that he is very worried on account of his eye illness, and became still more worried when the messenger Raḥmān b. Ḥaydara returned with no news. ""He who is absent imagines the worst. . . . If only the lady of the house [my wife] were with you. She is in the most dreadful state, fasting and weeping day and night.

I have explained this matter to him, and al-Faqīh al-Mudarris has also met with him regarding this. He wished to release the grain, but had to travel suddenly. May God make the end good."" Umm Sulaymān sends her regards and rebukes. The writer sends regards to Sitt Misk and inquires about her daughter and about R. Menaḥem. Goitein does not explain why he identifies the addressee as the writer's son-in-law or when/where they would have shared living quarters.

He apologizes for not visiting the house while he has been away on a business trip, probably from Fustat to the Ṣaʿīd (upper Egypt). He also writes that his business trip was successful, despite some difficulties, and that she should not worry. (In a postscript: ""If you are thinking of my journey the time I visited you in Dalāṣ(?) with the camel(?) with its tail cut off—this journey was not like that journey""). He conveys greetings also to his own wife whom he calls ṣāḥibat al-bayt. Goitein reasonably assumed that the word Qubaybiyya referred to the mother, and he noted that two villages in the Aṭfīḥ district are called Qubaybāt. However, the word appears with Abū l-Manṣūr's name rather than his mother's, and the word is unambiguously part of his own name in ENA 2806.4, his petition to Maṣliaḥ Gaʾon. It may be a toponym referring to one of the villages called Qubayba near Jerusalem, especially if this is the same man called al-Muqaddasī/al-Maqdisī in T-S 6J4.12.

The first patient has a corneal ulcer (""of the third type""), marble-like leucoma, and acute ophthalmia that is bloody and yellow-bilious. Abu Zikri has tried bloodletting and draining the ulcer with a pastille of sweet violet to no avail. The second patient has very acute ophthalmia, lachrymation, and an inveterate scaly eruption in the eye (""of the fourth type""). The third patient has an unspecified perforation ""like that of the patient whom you were treating."" Abu Zikri also requests that Abu 'Ali send him a black-lead ophthalmic from his own stock, since all the ophthalmics Abu 'Ali's father had sent were ineffective. He invites Abu 'Ali to spend time with him outside of the capital and sends regards to the recipient's mother, father, and Abu l-Ḥasan. On verso: Abu 'Ali responds to Abu Zikri's questions, writing in the spaces around three lines of large chancery-script Arabic. The upper part of the page is damaged. Abu 'Ali states that these are very serious conditions. Regarding the first patient, Abu 'Ali recommends the use of the ""white"" (ophthalmic), gradual and careful application of frankincense to clean the ulcer, followed by application of a powder from washed ""shanj"" (Cytinus hypocistis according to Efraim Lev, citing Issa Bey), and then administration of three ounces, morning and evening, of a potion of sweet violet and water lily or a potion of cherry. The patient must refrain from sleeping in the daytime. Abu 'Ali recommends that Abu Zikri bring him the patient so that he can examine him himself. Regarding the second patient, Abu 'Ali says that the remedy varies according to whether the ophthalmia is simple or complex. Abu Zikri must not neglect the scaly eruption, in that the use of too much ben tree or water lily or white alum can exacerbate it. Regarding the third patient, Abu 'Ali suggests the use of the black-lead ophthalmic, burnt, together with ben tree and camphor or whatever else Abu Zikri sees fit to use. Abu 'Ali recommends lightening the diet as much as possible. He alludes to a potion that Abu Zikri is already familiar with, and suggests that the patient may benefit from smelling myrtle, water lily, or dates. If the condition is refractory, Abu Zikri may give almonds or a potion of sweet violet. Finally, he requests to be informed whether these remedies work, and whether the patients have headaches or not.

Avraham the Nagid and the letter includes a complaint against an Alexandrian Ḥaver who took it upon himself to distribute the loaves of bread against the instructions of the Nagid and the local judge. Apparently, the letter was composed during a period of food shortage and the Nagid decreed that bread will be distributed in small portions in order to stock up for an emergency. The Ḥaver's decision to distribute all the bread of the collection must certainly have been popular among the needy.

The letter contains information about a communal conflict between Anatoli the Judge and Yehuda's paternal uncle—Ṣadoq b. Shemuel b. al-ʿAmmānī—and his son Mufaḍḍal. (Frenkel suggests this is the same case against a judge that Yehuda mentions in T-S 13J21.25, but that letter was written in 1208.) Ṣadoq had made a taqqana and collected signatures of important Alexandrians such as Abū Saʿd b. Nānū and Bū l-Rabīʿ al-Kohen in order to appoint his son Mufaḍḍal to lead the congregation (as judge?), but Mufaḍḍal is young, beardless, and unmarried, and therefore regarded as unfit to lead the congregation over an older, distinguished man. Moreover, Ṣadoq went to the Nagid Avraham Maimonides for approval of the taqqana behind the back of Anatoli the Judge, who was understandably angry when he heard. It seems that Mufaḍḍal has been shunned by most of the population for the last few months. Yehuda himself is waiting for the Nagid to respond with a fatwa to a query of his own, and he is resentful that the Nagid does not recognize that Yehuda is the one who is managing all the affairs of the synagogue, while his uncle is addicted to wine and incompetent (Med Soc V, 39 and 516, n. 148). Yehuda mentions the Tāj (the Aleppo Codex) ""which was written and pointed by Ben Asher or Ben Naftali"" in the last line of the main text on verso. The addressee Abū l-Majd was recently sick, and others in his household still are. See also T-S 16.305, a letter written in spring 1217 in which Yehuda thanks Avraham Maimonides for resolving the conflict between him and his uncle.

The other letter is CUL Or.1080 3.46, addressed to her brother Abu ʿUmar Ibn Sabra. The present letter is addressed to Abū l-Faḍl Ibn Sabra, whom Goitein identified as her maternal uncle and as Mevorakh b. Avraham b. Yiṣḥaq Ibn Sabra. She describes some of the background of her current situation: her mother-in-law (the addressee's sister) had long nursed enmity against her. At one point Umm Sitt al-Nās had to leave her own family's location and move in with the husband and mother-in-law. ""First, we all moved into one house. Soon my mother-in-law began to work against me, isolating me from everyone and putting enmity against me into the heart of her son. The least she did was that she said to me: 'Go away and become like your notorious mother.'"" Umm Sitt al-Nās then probably alludes to her mother (the sister of both the addressee and the mother-in-law) when she writes, ""You remember well how everyone reacted to your sister Baqā'."" A man—perhaps the writer's husband or perhaps her father-in-law (per Goitein)—then accused Umm Sitt al-Nās of adultery with her cousin (ibn ʿamm). Ultimately she was turned out of the house, ""naked and lost."" She has been staying with a widow who took her in, and she wishes to travel to her uncle and stay with him, as she has no one else to turn to. She requests 20 dirhams and a mantle (ridā') and a ""women's cap"" (? maʿraqa). Goitein speculated that she is suffering from ""a grave palsy"" (shallan adīda) but there is nothing in the context to suggest an illness, and adīdah is a much rarer word than the other possibility, urīduhu. Perhaps the sentence simply means that in the widow's house, she cannot even obtain a skein of yarn (this would also fit with her preoccupation with her lack of clothing).

Joseph and his father enter into a partnership with Mufaḍḍal in a sugar factory, splitting profits and losses evenly. Mufaḍḍal gave 50 dinars to ""his Elder"" (possibly his grandfather), which would act as capital to be used by the grandfather to purchase raw sugar; as well as an additional 50 dinars to his partners. The purpose of this document is to bring Mufaḍḍal into the relationship between Abū al-‘Alā and his father; no qinyan between the father and son is recorded here. Goitein points out that although the relationship is well-defined here, it may not have been canonized with a formal qinyan. The document may have been written for Mufaḍḍal and to record his investment (100 dinars) and the split of profits or losses due to him.The sole preserved signatory, the judge Yehiel b.

Abu Sahl Levi, at one time the cantor of the Palestinian synagogue in Fustat, who signs his name Ḥasan b. Sahl. The letter is a detailed explanation of the funeral and financial arrangements following the death of his father Levi and his brother Moshe, with the aim of exonerating himself from the accusations of Abu l-Bayan and Abu l-Fadl (the sons of Moshe?) that Yedutun “took the property of their father and grandfather.” Yedutun’s father, Levi he-Ḥaver, died on the 24th of Tishrei in 1211. His brother, Moshe b. Levi ha-Levi, died on the 20th of Adar in 1212. (This is consistent with the information from T-S NS 264.98, a letter written by Moshe, indicating that both Moshe and Levi were alive in 1206.) We also learn that Abu l-Mufaddal the judge died in 1212, only a month or so following the death of Moshe. Yedutun repeatedly refers to his own illnesses, claiming that he was too ill to have had any part in the disposition of the estates, let alone steal more than his share. He notes in the postscript, again emphasizing his physical infirmities, ""It has been 24 years since my brother Musa died. [If there is substance to their claims,] how have they ignored this matter for all this time? ... Every penny that falls into my or my wife/family's hands goes to [Abu l-]Bayan... and it is the same with Abu l-Fadl."" This letter clarifies an ambiguity discussed by Shulamit Elizur in her article, “Individual Mourning and National Solace in Early Liturgical Poetry,” Ginzei Qedem 7 (2011), pp. 16–24, in which she presents T-S NS 135.3b (Yedutun’s elegy for his father Levi) and T-S NS 325.135 (Yedutun’s elegy for his brother Moshe). Each poem mourns multiple deaths—a father, a brother, and a judge—in addition to the main subject of the elegy, and this letter clarifies that Yedutun indeed lost a father, a brother, and a judge in rapid succession.

3123,Letter,"illness letter 969-1517, Arabic address, bonesetter, Illness, illness: MSK, illness: back","Letter from a man to his 'brother' Abū l-Khayr and to his brother Manṣūr al-Dhabbāḥ, in Fustat. In Judaeo-Arabic, with the address in Arabic script. The writer urges his brother to end his itinerant lifestyle and return from the ""iron furnace"" to a life of ease with his family; this would be like living ""in Paradise after Hell."" There is a key ambiguity in interpreting the remainder of the letter. Goitein understood the addressee to be the writer's brother-in-law (perhaps because of צהרי in ll. 15–16) and the word ʿāṭib (""perishing, destroyed', ll. 6, 16) to be referring to the addressee whom Goitein writes was ""reported drowned."" But the word ʿāṭib is attributed to the bonesetter (mujabbir) in line 6 and to Ibn al-Dihqān in line 16, and the Judaeo-Arabic צהרי can mean ""my back"" (ظهري) just as well as the more common ""my brother-in-law"" (صهري). Thus, another possible reading: ""I arrived in good health, but when I arrived, I went to the bonesetter (al-mujabbir), who said, 'You are a wreck (ʿāṭib).' But all turned out well."" The writer goes on to explain why he himself left his family: because no one in Fustat could properly treat his illness. He went to Ibn al-Dihqān (when still in Fustat?), who did not know whether his back was ʿāṭib or not. Perhaps ʿāṭib is a technical term related to back pain, or just meaning something like ""incurable."" The remainder of the letter is quite damaged. The margin mentions the writer's illness/pain, the  bonesetter, and perhaps the healing of a wound (ובנא לחם). This document is of particular interest, because references to bonesetters are rare in Geniza documents. Apart from this one: F 1908.44W, where they are called raddādīn; and CUL Or.1080 J214, where they are not named, but the writer had had his leg ""pulled"" (shuddat ʿalayhi) unsucessfully.

And so the boy cried out [in the name of] Islam, and the Muslims gathered in his support (wa-ʾinna al-muslimīn taʿaṣṣabū maʿahu), and they took him [the father] and brought him before the governor. He [probably the boy] said to them, “The punishments of Islam (ḥadd) are not applicable, since I am not mature yet.” The qāḍī Ibn Ghāriḍ deliberated [the matter] and ratified his conversion to Islam (rajaʿa jaddada ʿalayhi al-islām). And there were many debates concerning this, [which] will be too long to elaborate""; (4) lancets (ruwayshāt) for bloodletting that the addressee promised to send; (5) a report that friends and family speak well of the addressee (he had asked to be told what people were saying behind his back); (6) a bakers' strike translated by Goitein as follows: ""On the second day of the Sukkot feast there were great disturbances in Alexandria because of the bread, which could not be found all over the city, until God brought relief by the end of the day; the governor (al-amīr) and the superintendent of the markets (al-muḥtasib) rode out and threatened to burn down [the houses of] the bakers because of the bread, after they had inquired with the people at one oven in the east and one in the west. At the end there remained fifty hundred weights of bread in the ovens that night.

Although Abū al-Khayr may not have been the sole active partner, the document declares trustworthy concerning profit and loss, a phrase often applied to the active partner in a long-distance partnership. Perhaps he had to relinquish some control of the enterprise in his final days as he was ill. His death is recorded on lines 9-10. Although the death of a partner is a sufficient condition for termination of a partnership in Jewish and Islamic law, the typical termination clauses are absent.

She asks the addressee to buy for her a black girl about 5 or 6 years of age from the jālib (slave trader), because she has heard that there are many available in Bahnasa (r15–17).

In Judaeo-Arabic. Dating unknown. The letter is convoluted and repetitive, giving the impression of having been dictated. The purpose of writing is to urge the addressee to stop trying to obtain a government salary (jāmakiyya) and to apply only for a license (dustūr), for he if persists in seeking the salary, they will refuse him even the license. The writer and those with him have been on tenterhooks regarding the addressee's news, in a state of anxiety (hamm) and fasting (ṣiyām). He writes that it would be better to treat patients for free than to have the government salary, even if it were 100 dinars. It seems that the government salary would also require the physician to return to Damīra and practice there, an outcome the writer is desperate to avoid. ""If you return to Damīra, it will be our destruction (dimārnā)."" The writer (humorously) insists that here in Damīra there has been no season (faṣl, of illness), and disease (maraḍ) and ophthalmia (ramad) are nowhere to be found; there is no demand for the addressee's services, for everyone is healthy. (Whether intentionally or not, this passage echoes the first chapter of Ibn Buṭlān's Daʿwat al-Aṭṭibā', in which a shifty physician in Mayyāfāriqīn tries to convince a newcomer and potential competitor that all the diseases have disappeared.) The family is not from Damīra originally (the writer calls it bilād al-ghurba); the writer wants to return to their hometown where they own property and do not have to pay 10 dirhams a month for rent. Meanwhile, the family is perishing from the cold, and the children are 'naked.' The writer himself is ill: in a postscript, he writes, ""Do not even ask about me: the illness has gotten seriously worse (zāda bī jiddan). Now, pieces of bloody phlegm (qiṭaʿ balgham dam) are coming up, together with the intense pain (al-alam al-shadīd). How often this flares up in me (yathūr bī)!""

In Judaeo-Arabic. Dated 23 Shevat, 1208 CE. Yehuda copied for Meir dirges (qinnot) and liturgical poetry (piyyutim). The whole letter deals with the exchange of professional news and information between the two cantors. In particular, R. ʿOvadya the cantor from Damascus was meant to deliver certain piyyutim, but he departed suddenly without warning, which is why Yehuda is sending them with the present letter (r6-12). Yehuda rebukes Meir for sending him vague requests without specifying the opening lines of the piyyutim, which cools Yehuda's ardor for fulfilling his requests (r12-17). He also asks Meir to send back the note about the reading of Deut. 1:44, which Yehuda had seen in the Tāj (the Aleppo Codex) (r17-19). He also wants Meir to send him the fatwa that relates to Yehuda's court case against a judge (r20-22). He asks if ʿOvadya is planning to travel again (r23-24) and concludes with greetings. See Goitein, Med. Soc. II, 548 n. 59, for an explanation of the date in this letter and in T-S 16.287. Yehuda writes 168, with 4800 implied, so the year is 4968.

In the letter are found the repercussions of the arrival of French rabbis to Alexandria. The community seems to be in a serious crisis due to the lack of leadership. (Information from Frenkel.) Yehuda additionally congratulates Abū l-Majd on his recovery (r.7-12) and agrees that his illness is primarily caused by drinking too much wine and that he should moderate his drinking (r.22-24). He refers to a frail woman (r.14-15). He reports that Abū l-Majd's brother Abu l-Najm Hilal is ill: he never fully recovered since a nail entered his leg months ago, and he does not or cannot open his mouth (r.15-19). He only reports this because it is said that Hilāl may be on his deathbed. (Cf. INA D-55 f.4, also known as IOM D 55.4, summarized in Med Soc II, 220 and V, 155, in which Yehuda writes to Eliyyahu the Judge that “[Hilāl] went to rest in the evening and did not awake in the morning. It was the first day of the holiday, and he was buried on the same day; he left a fine boy of sixteen, who studies with me.” However, Hilāl's fatal illness was different than the one mentioned in this letter, as Hilāl was still alive in December 1214 when he wrote T-S 13J21.27, having recently traveled from Alexandria to Fustat and back.) Yehuda devotes much space to discussing piyyutim that these two cantors have sent or will send each other (r.25-v.9); rebukes Abū l-Majd for failing to date his letters (v.1-4); mentions the financial difficulties in his household (v.9-10); mentions Abū l-Faraj b. al-Rayyis (=Eliyyahu the Judge) and his fundraising for Jerusalem (v.10-13); and ends with a recommendation for R.

Yoshiyya Ibn al-Dhahabī and Khalaf b. ʿIzrūn, which seems to have been canonized in an ""Arabic document"" in the hand of the latter. The document seems to have been the product of an Islamic court, as it ""bear[s] testimony of non-Jews"". The partners release each other from a number of possible partnership forms: the khulṭa, the shirka, and the muʿāmala. The partners also release each other from any qirāḍ later in the release clauses; this is certainly because of the linguistic relationship between qirāḍ and qarḍa (though qarḍa refers to a loan, not a partnership agreement). The partners also absolve each other from all oaths, including the ḥerem setam or ""anonymous ban"" (imposed by the Geonim as the ""oath of partners"" to prevent malfeasance). These partners likely worked together as partners for a number of years. In T-S 13J1.16, dated to 1066, Yosef appoints Khalaf his agent. It's possible that T-S 16.138 is a release from that agency relationship, but lines 18-19 suggest that the two parties later restructured their relationship and contracted as partners, from which the present document grants release. The signatories, Mawhūb the Ḥazzan b. Aharon the Ḥazzan and Shela b. Mevasser, are well-known members of the rabbinical court of Alexandria at the end of the eleventh century.

Moshe b. Sughmār, in al-Mahdiyya, to his brother Yehuda, in Fustat. In Judaeo-Arabic. Dating: January 9 (12 Shevat), 1058 CE (Gil) or 1061 CE (Ben-Sasson). Labrāṭ congratulates Yehuda on the birth of his firstborn son. There may be a prayer for God to protect the infant from the evil eye (r11–12; the first letter of the word is smudged; Gil reads al-ḍaw' rather than al-sū'; neither one is strictly grammatical). Labrāṭ heard from Zakkār that the infant was a girl and was only reassured when Yehuda's letter arrived with the news that it was a boy. Labrāṭ keeps the blessed letter with him and kisses it and puts it before his eyes; he gave it to his sister this week but made her promise to return it (r4–18). Labrāṭ continues with business affairs. There is an elaborate response to what Yehuda said about the pain Labrāṭ caused him by rebuking him about a business decision taken by Yehuda. Labrāṭ only wrote anything because it concerned somebody else's merchandise. As for what is owed to him by Yehuda, what are 20 dinars next to their relationship, which is worth the whole world? If Yehuda was agitated by Labrāṭ's rebuke, Labrāṭ is now agitated by Yehuda's response. Furthermore, this sum is nothing compared to what they already lost in Qayrawān. As the proverb goes, ""If nothing is left of your provisions except a single cake, you might as well throw it into the sea"" (r18–32). The letter continues with matters of trade between Ifrīqiyya, Sicily, and Egypt. Numerous people are mentioned: the Nagid, Nissim, Abū Hārūn, Ḥayyim b. ʿAmmār, the boy of Ḥassūn, Ḥassūn b. Mūsā, Yehuda b. Mūsā, Abū ʿAbd Allāh, the notables of Qayrawān and al-Mahdiyya, Isḥāq b. Bar[hūn?], and Yosef b. Eli al-Kohen. People who came from Palermo said that Zakkār was sick but then recovered (r33–57). Labrāṭ is delighted to hear that Yehuda has been studying Torah, Mishna, and Talmud with 'the Rav' (r58 and margin). Verso consists mainly of greetings. Labrāṭ is surprised at Yehuda's rebuke for Nissim's failure to send him letters. (Gil identifies this man with Nissim b. Moshe ha-Shelishi.) Nissim hasn't even written to Labrāṭ, who is two hours away from him. ""He is dying, and he should write you a letter?"" (v11–13). Nissim redeemed a Bible codex which belongs to Labrāṭ and Yehuda, and which had been plundered in one of the wars of Ifrīqiyya. Labrāṭ now wishes to make arrangements to reimburse Nissim and get it back (v13–17, 23–24). Labrāṭ concludes with the bad news of Ifrīqiyya, Sicily, and al-Andalus (v35–40). The price of wheat has skyrocketed this summer; Qayrawān is a ruin; the Bedouins are waging war on each other; people are worried about Sicily this year, for the Franks have attacked with a great army; they ('Franks') have also invaded al-Andalus this year and destroyed many of its villages, killed many people, and imposed taxes on all the areas they conquered.

Goitein points out that in addition to the partnership funds trusted to Yaḥyā, ‘Ūlla entrusted a consignment of scammony (a medicinal plant) which was “on commission”, suggesting that “business in general was largely conducted on the basis of mutual trust and friendship”. On the other hand, the dispute at hand concerns specific details of the partnership, including a dispute concerning the possible markets to which Yaḥyā was empowered to travel (Damietta, Alexandria, and the Maghreb); the partnership is terminated prior to Yaḥyā’s journey to the Maghreb.

The partners (Abū al-Barakāt and Abū al-Faraj) split losses evenly but grant the active partner (Abū al-Faraj) thirteen twenty-fourths of the profit. In fact, the document specifies two twenty-fourths of the profit allocated to Abū al-Faraj, the amount by which his share exceeded Abū al-Barakāt's, as ""remuneration [for his trouble and work]"". Per Maimonides, the share of profits allocated to the active partner must be at equal to or greater than the share of losses. This  suggests that in this case only 1/24 of the thirteen twenty-fourths of the profit allocated to Abū al-Faraj is the “additional amount” corresponding to payment for his work. The document is explicit that profits are split ""evenly"" (each partner receives eleven twenty-fourths), and an ""additional amount"" of two twenty-fourths is to be allocated to Abū al-Faraj. Abū al-Faraj is to have free disposal of the partnership capital, part of which is considered a loan, without any recourse to Abū al-Barakāt. Abū al-Barakāt also declares that his partner’s testimony would be trusted, even though both partners are supposed to perform an accounting. A copy of the partnership agreement is written for each of the parties' records. Should the partnership be terminated by either party before the end of the fixed period (which is not evident in the document, possibly due to deterioration), the terminating partner would be required to pay the other 50 dinars as an outright gift. If Abū al-Barakāt were to terminate the partnership prematurely, he would lose the entire amount putatively loaned to Abū al-Faraj, which was likely half his capital.

The letter deals with a case to be brought before the Nagid Yehoshua Maimonides (1310–55) b. Avraham II (1245–1313) b. David (1222–1300) b. Avraham (1186–1237) b. Moshe (1135–1204), containing circumstantial evidence (amāra) and details sustaining it. The first part of the letter (r1–17) includes lengthy apologies for failing to visit when he heard that his mother was sick. He was unable to come because of the expense of renting an animal, the danger of the journey, and because he was suffering from ophthalmia ('but now, thank God, I am better'). In the next part of the letter (r18–v1), he informs his mother that he remarried four months earlier, to a beautiful virgin who shares all of his mother's good traits and who is the fulfillment of his mother's prayers for him. His wife is distressed on behalf of her mother-in-law's illness and wishes to come to visit. Goitein suggests that the key to why Surūr neglected to tell his mother or ask her permission prior to the marriage lies in his neglect to mention his wife's name or that she comes from a good family. Most likely, she did not come from a good family, and his mother would have disapproved. In the third part of the letter (v1–27), he gets to the main purpose of writing: he had loaned a siddur to a pilgrim to Palestine named Fakhr against a security of 6.5 nuqra dirhams (containing three times as much silver as regular dirhams). Now that Fakhr has returned to Cairo, he has heard that family members already returned the silver, but Fakhr refused to return the siddur. The writer wishes Fakhr to be pressured to return the siddur. He suggests first that his family tell Sulaymān al-ʿAṭṭār, who mediated the original loan/security, ""So-and-so [Surūr] says such-and-such to you with the following signs."" He then recounts the story of how Sulaymān and Fakhr stayed in the khān in Bilbays with six other pilgrims (al-Shaykh Muwaffaq the cantor, Saʿīd b. al-Kātib, Nāṣir b. Ṭayyib, Yehoshua b. al-Ghāriq, Mūsā b. Mardūk, and Ibn Abū Saʿd al-Khādim), and how they were stranded there over Shabbat when the caravan left. If Sulaymān's intervention doesn't work, Surūr's brother Faraj Allāh should approach the Nagid Yehoshua. He then gives ""signs"" to remind the Nagid of his case: how, when he visited Bilbays, he spoke with Surūr about the copy of a Bible belonging to Yaʿqūb the brother of the teacher; how the Nagid was involved in Surūr's divorce from his first wife; and how the Nagid went to see the head of police (wālī) of Bilbays, who directed him to the Qadi, who was not available. If this doesn't work, he suggests that his brother go to Yaʿqūb the brother of the teacher and solicit his help.

The amīr wanted the approval of the gaon before doing this, so Daniel wrote to the gaon (l. 50), who granted approval. The amir then required further approval from...

In Hebrew and Judaeo-Arabic. Dating: ca. 1230s. The purpose of the letter is to relate various improprieties (""matters proceeding not as they should,"" r13–14) of a muqaddam (perhaps of Minyat Ghamr?), al-Shaykh al-Sadīd. The first episode (r17–32): The local schoolteacher had to go to Cairo to pay his capitation tax (jizya) because he was originally from the Levant. When the teacher was delayed in returning, the community began talking about hiring a new teacher. Al-Sadīd caught wind of this and vetoed the proposal, fearing that a new teacher would be a nuisance (tashwīsh) to him, and he insisted that he teach the children himself. They responded that he was far too busy with his medical practice and serving as muqaddam, not to mention his business dealings. He persisted, and they said, ""But you don't even live here!"" He said that he would come live there until the original teacher came back. The teacher came back, and al-Sadīd was so enthusiastic about the additional income that he refused to let the children return to the original teacher, and he had made their parents vow to that effect. The community felt pity on the original teacher because of his poverty. The second episode (r32–45): During the same period of al-Sadīd teaching the children, someone fell sick in Minyat Zifta. A group of people, including another physician named al-Shaykh al-Muhadhdhab, came to visit the patient and found al-Sadīd attending him. Al-Sadīd rudely ignored al-Muhadhdhab. After everyone had sat around the patient, al-Muhadhdhab said, ""Are you angry at me? I have been courteous to you, just like the community. I don't know what you want from me. I left you the synagogue and didn't attend today."" Al-Sadīd (saracastically): ""Thank God you found people to support you (against me?)."" The writer of the letter editorializes: There were many people present who also don't attend the synagogue, but not because they were supporting al-Muhadhdhab, rather because they heard about how al-Sadīd had disparaged them. Back to the story: Al-Sadīd sighed and said: ""How I hold back from complaining about my travails!"" The writer: He didn't hold back at all. The third episode (r45–end): A certain judge (qāḍī al-ḥukm) was seriously ill (marīḍ bi-maraḍ shadīd), and al-Muhadhdhab was attending him ""[against] his will and not for his good."" This is unclear: was al-Muhadhdhab treating the judge incompetently, or was al-Muhadhdhab the one somehow coerced into this job? Meanwhile, al-Sadīd had been angling to get a connection to this judge. The judge had a slave with jaundice (khadīm bihi yaraqān). This too is unclear: is the slave acutely ill, or is this simply a description of his chronic state? Al-Sadīd came and spoke to the slave, and then came back with something to give to the slave—and the story ends here, unless the join is found. This document is possibly related to Bodl. MS heb. a 3/15, a letter from Avraham Maimonides ordering a territorial muqaddam in Minyat Zifta/Minyat Ghamr to share his duties with his cousin al-Shaykh al-Muhadhdhab.

3567,Letter,"medicine, physicians, Yehuda b. al-'Ammani, bimaristan, tazkiya, 4800, dating tricks","Letter from the teacher Bū l-Ḥusayn Yehuda (b. Aharon?) Ibn al-ʿAmmānī, in Alexandria, to his third cousin and brother-in-law the physician Yeshuʿa b. Aharon Ibn al-ʿAmmānī, in the hospital in Cairo. In Judaeo-Arabic. Dated: 12 Elul [4800+]168 = 4968 AM, which is 1208 CE (although Goitein's index card says 1217 or 1228 CE, maybe because he was working from a photostat). First section (r5–34): Yehuda specifies the steps he has taken to ensure the addressee's success in the study of medicine in Fustat/Cairo in order to begin practicing in Alexandria. (The pronouns are somewhat confusing in this letter, and it is not out of the question that 'my brother' refers to someone other than the addressee.) Yehuda previously sent instructions with the boy Muhadhdhab b. Merayot al-Kohen. Yehuda advises the aspiring physician to present letters of recommendation to the wālī, to the qāḍī, to al-Muwaffaq, to Ibn Tammām the supervisor (al-mushārif), and to Ibn Ṣadaqa (Goitein says this is a well-known Samaritan physician). Whoever wishes to study with them must study in Fustat and gain his 'certificate of good conduct' (tazkiya) in Fustat. He should strive for nothing but the tazkiya and spare no expenses, because if he obtains the tazkiya, then he will have obtained everything, and he will quickly recover the money that he lost. Yehuda has also enclosed three additional letters with the bearer of the present letter, one of which is a letter from Ibn Alqāsh to al-Shaykh al-Sadīd the aspiring physician's professor (ustādh). Yehuda has also sent 5 letters with the gentile Manṣūr al-Ḥarīrī who is, a relative of the wife of Ibn al-Tinnīsī. 3 of these are from the faqīh Ibn ʿĪsā: the first is a response to the letter from the aspiring physician, the second is a letter of recommendation to a man called al-Sharaf in the hospital, and the third is a letter to the son of the faqīh Salāma Ibn al-Aʿmā (this one is unrelated to the aspiring physician). The other 2 of the 5 letters are from Yehuda himself, one addressed to the aspiring physician and one to the professor al-Sadīd. Yehuda wants to write a letter to al-Shaykh al-Muwaffaq Ibn al-Dimyāṭī but doesn't know his Hebrew name (Goitein understood ""fluency""), so he asks the aspiring physician to send a letter with that information. There are further instructions about Ibn al-Tinnīsī and obtaining a ruqʿa in the hand of the judge (al-dayyān) from the Qaraite al-Shaykh al-Thiqa. Second section (r35–48): Yehuda has sent several additional letters with ʿUmar the animal driver (al-mukārī) because he was worried about his brother. Yehuda is in distress from the capitation tax. Ibn Ruzayq told him that the addressee had guaranteed it for Yehuda. Yehuda argued with Ibn Ruzayq about this, and Yehuda secretly went to the Christian tax administrator (ʿāmil) and obtained an 10-day extension. It seems that the question is whether they ought to pay Yehuda's brother's capitation tax in Alexandria; Yehuda thinks the money would be wasted, since he can't believe that it hasn't already been paid in Fustat, a month in a half after the deadline. The Christian told him that he heard from someone that Yehuda's brother had already paid it to the treasury (bayt al-māl) and that the receipt (wuṣūl) should arrive soon. Yehuda is desperate to know soon, because they are already 'under threat' (taḥt al-tahdīd). Third section (r49–end): Yehuda describes a shameful matter in Alexandria, namely, how the government banished the scholar and merchant Yosef al-Baghdādī as a result of false accusations made by associates of the judge Anatoli. Yehuda had previously sent an update on this matter with ʿUmar al-Baghdādī. There was an initial denunciation to the Jewish judge somehow involving a convert and a claim that Yosef threw watermelon rinds and urine at someone (v3–4). Then there was a scene in the synagogue involving the tearing of clothes and Yosef either genuinely fainting or pretending to faint. Anatoli, Seʿadya al-Ḥasid, Hilāl (probably the brother of Meʾir b. Yakhin), and the allies of Anatoli were also there. Yosef was then denounced to the amir Ḥusām al-Dīn as someone who curses the Jewish law and who must be banished from the city. So the amir sent 'the black slave' and his attendant (farrāsh) to search for Yosef, calling out, 'Where is the foreigner who is cursing people and their ancestors?' Yehuda attempted to conceal Yosef from the search party by saying, 'This is a humble scholar and teacher who would never do such a thing.' But their informer Ṭāhir al-Dimashqī told on Yosef, and Yehuda received a reprimand for obstructing the government's justice. There follows a detailed description of the expulsion of Yosef.

Dated: Thursday, 27 Adar I 1415 Seleucid, which is 1104 CE. The document contains the proceedings before the court regarding the matter of dispute between two members of the community of Malīj, Shelomo b. Avraham (aka Salāma b. Ibrāhīm al-Sayrajī) and Peraḥya ha-Kohen b. Ṭarfon (aka Abū l-Surūr b. Ṭarīf). The story opens with a verbatim copy of another testimony (called a sheṭar/maḥḍar) dated 2.5 months earlier (Saturday night 12 Ṭevet 1415 Seleucid), in which the witnesses Mevorakh b. Yiṣḥaq, Yosef b. Mevorakh, and Elʿazar b. Yosef testify that they entered the house of a Jew named Bashshār and found Salāma b. Ibrāhīm assailing Abū l-Surūr b. Ṭarīf and hanging on to his clothing; the latter was not defending himself. Salāma insisted on taking Abū l-Surūr before the government (sulṭan); Abū l-Surūr insisted on taking Salāma to the Jewish courts (before 'the Rayyis'). Salāma then insulted the Rayyis and said, ""I am [King] Baldwin (Bardawīl), and Abū l-Surūr is my prisoner!"" Salāma summoned the police (rajjāla) and had Abū l-Surūr and Yūsuf b. Rajā and Yūsuf b. Manṣūr taken before the Muslim courts/government (headed by ""the amir""). The amir nearly had the defendants beaten. (End of first document.) Now, Abū l-Surūr has finally succeeded in bringing Salāma before the Jewish court and ""sayyidnā"" (though the pronouns are not entirely clear in l. 4 and it could also be Salāma suing Abū l-Surūr). The court orders Salāma to justify his behavior. Salāma says to summon the witnesses. The court refuses, saying, And what if they don't obey the order? Abū l-Surūr says that the court should use the ḥerem stam (blanket excommunication) to coerce people into reporting any communication they received from Salāma to antagonize Abū l-Surūr before the Muslim courts. Either Salāma or Abū l-Surūr at this point accuses the other of bearing false witness in the Jewish court (""before Sayyidnā""). The court  reads out a letter that Salāma confesses to be his own, in which he accuses a troublemaker (=Abū l-Surūr) who had been exiled from Malīj to Cairo of sending letters to Ibn al-Qāsh the dyer and to the shoṭer and the nadiv to the effect that they aren't rid of him yet, since he will return as soon as Rabbenu dies. The court asks Salāma on what basis he made that claim, and Salāma can only respond that someone (he refuses to say who) told him about Abū l-Surūr's alleged letters. The court believes Abū l-Surūr's side of the story, but also issues a ḥerem stam commanding anyone who did receive a troublemaking letter from Abū l-Surūr to come forward with it. The shoṭer and the nadiv are present, and they deny receiving any such letter from Abū l-Surūr. The document ends abruptly with the line, ""The day broke, and the crowd dispersed."" ASE"
3570,Letter,"India, IB6, testimony, merchant, outburst, estrangement","Letter containing the testimony of Makhlūf, a respectable merchant, who had to flee from Alexandria before an oppressive government official, 'the plundering monk,' Abu Najah, and to hide in the western desert for years. He had arrived in Alexandria in the spring following Abu Najah's death, traveled to Ifrīqiya in the summer of the year 1130, and wrote the letter the following summer, that is, 1131. The writer was appointed as an overseer of the Sultan's ships. It is also an extraordinary document of estrangement between father and son. The son loved music, Italian wine and bad company, and, of course, was always in debt. All attempts of the father to correct him: presenting him to the qadi of Alexandria, taking him on a trip to Ifrīqiya, sending him to the countryside on administrative work, suggesting to him travels to Yemen and to Syria were of no avail. The young man of twenty-two was not a mere good-for-nothing. He was allergic to his father: 'as long as you are alive, I have bad luck. As soon as you are dead, I shall be successful.'

""At the beginning of the 13th century there were two communities in Jerusalem which were established after the city was conquered by Salah al-Din in 1191: the Ashkelonite community and the Maghrebi community. Beginning in 1210, a wave of pilgrims – known as the Emigration of the Rabbis – arrived from France and England. Relations between the various communities were very tense, as testified by Yehuda Alharizi, who visited Jerusalem in 1214. From letters of R. Yehiel the Frenchman to Fustat, we learn about a heated debate that took place in Jerusalem at the time. Because the Jews were not allowed to immerse themselves in the Shiloah spring, a campaign was held in Egypt to build a new mikveh, and a large sum was collected and sent to the community in Jerusalem for this purpose. But R. Yehiel, the leader of the community, objected to the construction of a new mikveh, preferring that the women of the community immerse in a private mikveh in his home – according to him, this would enable his wife to supervise the women’s immersion. R. Yehiel appealed to the local judge in Fustat, asking permission to change the the donation’s destination. However, members of the local community were not satisfied with this arrangement, and tried to build a new mikveh. The ensuing dispute split the community, until R. Yehiel and his group were forced to leave the synagogue. The two groups did not hesitate to involve the Muslim ruler in the conflict, which led to the arrest of some members of the community. The controversy spilled over into an interethnic struggle, with tensions caused by changes based on the French halachic tradition instituted by R. Yehiel. Until now, we knew of this story from two pages published almost a century ago. With the discovery of five additional pages, we now have a full description of this episode from the history of Jerusalem in the early 13th century."" (Information from Roni Shweka.)

3909,Letter,"excommunication, Shelomo b. Eliyyahu, Avraham Maimonides, 13th c, death, Petition, prayer reforms","Letter in Judaeo-Arabic. Dating: Likely Tammuz 1232 CE, and almost definitely 1232–37 CE. See below for explanation. Writer and addressee are unidentified. The writer dictated the letter to his son. They were evidently affluent merchants and suppliers to the army. The letter is mainly about the controversy over the prayer reforms of the Nagid Avraham Maimonides. The sons of the Sixth (the family members of the previous dynasty of Nagids) submitted a petition against Avraham to the Sultan al-Malik al-ʿĀdil, to which Avraham responded with a counter-petition signed by almost 200 people from the community, testifying that he had not forced his prayer reforms on anybody. The writer maintains that all those who signed in favor of Avraham testified falsely and deserve to be punished by the shaving of their beards, for he claims that Avraham certainly did force his prayer reforms on the community in their synagogues. The writer goes on to report on recent deaths, including that of Shelomo b. Eliyyahu (who predeceased his father) and Yūsuf b. al-Kharrāz (who ate dinner and went to sleep and died; in the morning, his face was ""black as ink""). There is a section on the prices of various commodities, a section on relations with the military officer Kātib al-ʿArab, and greetings. As for the justification for the dating: Avraham Maimonides died in 1237. There were two sultans named al-Malik al-ʿĀdil. The first was the brother of Saladin and reigned 1200–18. The second was the grandson of the first (the son of al-Malik al-Kāmil) and reigned 1238–40, after the death of Avraham Maimonides. However, during the years 1232–38 when al-Malik al-Kāmil lived in Syria, al-Malik al-ʿĀdil the Younger sometimes represented his father in Egypt. Goitein determined that the reference must be to al-Malik al-ʿĀdil the First, which would date the document to 1204–18. But the plot thickens, because Shelomo b. Eliyyhau—whose death is reported in this document—was still alive in the month of Av in 1231 CE (Med Soc II, 575 n. 60) and Heshvan 1231 CE (Freer F 1908.44H). The present letter is dated Sunday 5 Tammuz. This narrows the window to 1232–37 CE. The trouble is that the 5th of Tammuz can never fall on a Sunday.... so either the scribe was off by a day or meant to write 15th of Tammuz. The latter option is supported by the phrase ""may its sadness be turned to joy,"" which might refer to the upcoming 17th of Tammuz fast.

All clothing and provisions of wheat and wine hoarded in the house of the writer's maternal uncle were plundered; even the rope of the well was taken way. The authority ordering the requisition is referred to as the biblical 'Haman the wicked'. (Information from Mediterranean Society, II, p. 393.) The sender himself was interrogated by the raqqāṣīn who were searching for his uncle, but he pretended to be not from there and fled. 

The letter refers to three obscure torture devices or techniques: ""they in{ser}ted the ʿṬY (עטי), the hinbāzīn (הנבאזין), and the khazm (? כזם) in their (the Jews') noses (v3). Later, the sender explains that a person who has had the ʿṬY enter his flesh will not heal (r5–6). The meaning of ʿṬY is not clear; khazm is also not clear, but comes from a root referring to piercing, sometimes nose piercing. The term hinbāzīn/הנבאזין/هنبازين is apparently known from Coptic martyrologies (according to some sources deriving from Greek ἑρμητάριον < Latin armentarium < Armentarius, the nickname of the emperor Galerius Maximianus); see https://st-takla.org/Coptic-Faith-Creed-Dogma/Coptic-Rite-n-Ritual-Taks-Al-Kanisa/Dictionary-of-Coptic-Ritual-Terms/9-Coptic-Terminology_Heh-Waw-Yeh/henbazeen.html and Phillips Barry, ""Martyrs' Milk"" (1914) (https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Open_Court/VuoXAQAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=ermetarion&pg=PA563&printsec=frontcover). 

Recto (original use): Ketubba for Sitt al-Banāt. In the hand of Natan b. Shelomo ha-Kohen (1125–50). The ends of 6 lines are preserved. The groom undertakes not to curse her or treat her with disrespect. The identification of the scribe as Natan b. Shelomo ha-Kohen allows us to tentatively date the letter to the last years of Maṣliaḥ Gaʾon (1138–39) when there was a mutiny against the government, and Maṣliaḥ picked the wrong side, so that many Jews were jailed and Maṣliaḥ himself was executed in 1139.

The letter is damaged but is a valuable source of information for the business of a druggist (ʿaṭṭār). Commodities mentioned include storax (mayʿa) and saffron. The writer does not know precisely the weight of the saffron; the addressee should weigh the burniyya together with the saffron in it and subtract the weight of the burniyya.

How this worked out in practice is seen in the daily accounts listing the sums expended for a sick foreigner and the sums showing how they were collected, as summarized here. The list is in the unmistakable hand of the judge Nathan b.

He prepared it and he will do it. As for what you sad, my brother, that I should rise and come, you know that I am busy with the speaking (?) of Najm al-Din until matters are stable (?) with him. On Wednesday, the day after the arrival of the letter, I went to Amin al-Din the son of the founder and bought five of indigo (nīl) from him. I gave him your letter and he read it and I kissed his hand and humbled myself and cried. He was pained and said, come back another time. He is good of heart and wishes for your delivery. He promised me. Every day I await for the response from him, and every day I go to him -- may God grant that salvation is at his hands, and the next letter after this one will tell of your salvation. My brother, I cannot travel until I have a letter with news of your delivery. There is no sense in traveling like this. I can't even buy or sell things until your matter is settled and the speaking (?) of Najm al-din. As for what you said about going to to al-Shams b. al-Muzawwiq - he did not leave me in Giza after he read your letter except that he was good (of health?). Maybe we don't need any of them. You know that he does not have any influence apart from money. Until now, nothing has been settled between me and him. If you need money, send word with someone you trust, and we will give it to him. My brother, there is fire in our hearts because of you. Mother and your sister and the Hakim all want to come to you.

In the hand of Ḥalfon b. Menashshe. This undated fragment concerns a partnership in money-changing; the active partner was Abū al-Surūr Peraḥya b. Menashshe, brother of Ḥalfōn b. Menashshe. The woman Nasab, mentioned on lines 10 and 13, is Peraḥya’s (and Ḥalfōn’s) mother. Peraḥya handed over some amount to his mother, which she acknowledged and recorded as a debt. These funds seem to have been a loan out of partnership capital, indicated by the mention of “the funds in his hands”. On the other hand, no description of the partnership itself is preserved here. The name of Peraḥya’s partner is also not preserved, though it may have been Ḥasan Eli b. Maṣliaḥ (mentioned in line13). It is unclear what role Eli played in the transaction.

The signatories are not preserved. But the title ""Mordecai of his time"" (see line 1) is applied to Moshe b.

Same sender and addressee as T-S 8J24.4 and CUL Or.1080 J25. The identities of sender(s) and addressee(s) are difficult to disentangle, but there is probably sufficient evidence contained within the letter. The tarjama reads, ""Your son Ibrāhīm,"" and both of the addresses are made out to Abū l-Ḥasan Ibrāhīm al-Maghribī, in the Goldsmiths' Market, in Fustat. But the main voice of the letter is that of a woman, who is dictating the letter to the scribe Ibrāhīm (perhaps her husband or brother), and she is addressing herself to an older female relative, likely her mother. She also greets her sister Umm Ismāʿīl. The main addressee, who may live with Umm Ismāʿīl, is supposed to tell Umm Ismāʿīl to have her husband (perhaps the Abū l-Ḥasan Ibrāhīm from the address) send a letter with their news. The scribe Ibrāhīm then takes over the letter and greets Abū l-Ḥasan (and his father and his children) and rebukes him for his treatment of a woman (perhaps his wife Umm Ibrāhīm), ""This is not what we agreed upon, and this is not how I instructed you (to behave). Whatever you do to her, you do to us."" There are regards to various other people, including Sitt Zahr and Abū l-Rabīʿ Sulaymān and his son Ibrāhīm and his mother. As for the content of the letter proper, the sender reports that her daughter (Sitt al-Niʿam) and son (Abū l-Ḥasan) both fell off of a roof, but they were not seriously injured (cf. CUL Or.1080 J25, v22–27). She reports on a woman named Ṣayd (aka Sitt al-Ṣayd), who may be a slave, and who wishes to marry the slave of Ibn Miṣbāḥ, which apparently causes great distress for her owners (this section should be clarified by comparison with CUL Or.1080 J25, v4–12). She asks for her ring to be sent with the addressee's cousin (bint khāl) Sitt Nasrīn, and for a garment to be sold in Qūṣ and for something (""aṭrāf"") to be made for Abū l-Ḥasan with the money from the sale. NB: Goitein originally described this as a letter from Ibrahim to his sister, writing about a widow with children who was intending to marry a person who obviously had not too good a reputation. The judge had warned her but she insisted on marrying the man. The writer tells about the children and complains about neglect.

Before turning to Nahray he had already received donations from another prominent Ifrīqiyan merchant, Abū Zikri (Yehuda b. Moshe ibn Sughmār). Nahray had become annoyed. It is not clear whether he was angry because he felt that people might have thought he was neglecting his relative or became peeved for some other reason, such as competition over patronage--or perhaps both (Cohen). In any case, the writer promised henceforth to rely only on Nahray. But since then Nahray has only paid him the insufficient sum of 15 dirhams over the course of eight months.

He devotes much of the letter to a vivid description of his illnesses. “As for my state, I inform the masters that I came down with diarrhea, and I endured it.

This fragment contains two documents related to the same partnership agreement, filed in the court one after the other over a two-day period in January 1079. The first document, unsigned and seemingly copied in lines 1-12, represents the termination of a partnership and a corresponding mutual release of three partners, Ghālib b. Ḥalfōn, Moses b. Ghālib, and Meshullam b. Furqān. Ghālib releases Moses and Meshullam; Moses and Meshullam release Ghālib. That Moses and Meshullam did not release one another in this document suggests either that the document was Ghālib’s copy of a mutual release and that other copies were written for Moses and Meshullam, or that Ghālib was the active partner and Moses and Meshullam were his investors. If the latter, Moses and Meshullam would have had no mutual obligations and therefore no need to release one another. This explanation is consistent with lines 13-28, which describe Ghālib and Moses' partnership. As a settlement, Ghālib agrees to pay Moses and Meshullam  each month in order to settle the balance (seven dinars). Meshullam's role in the partnership is unclear; only Ghālib and Moses are mentioned as partners in the olive-oil concern. (Information from Lieberman, ""A Partnership Culture,"" 127)"

T-S AS 154.128 + T-S AS 147.5a is the roughest version; T-S AS 154.226 + T-S AS 147.5b is a clean copy; and  T-S AS 154.127 is a third copy filling in a few of the phrases from the section preceding the portion preserved in the other two copies. This is a fundraising appeal on behalf of a captive who has been granted a short period of time to travel to raise money for his ransom. The total ransom was 110 dinars (an exorbitant sum for a single captive; maybe he is raising money for 3 or 4 people, though this is not mentioned anywhere in the document). The congregation of Fustat has already raised 80 dinars, and he now must raise the remaining 30 dinars. The different copies are inconsistent about who stood security for him to allow him to travel. T-S AS 154.128 + T-S AS 147.5a says that it was ""some of the Byzantines"" (baʿḍ al-rūm), but this is crossed out and replaced with ""the ḥaverim of ʿAsqalān, may they be remembered with a thousand blessings."" The other two copies revert to mentioning the Byzantines rather than the ḥaverim of Ashqelon. The unfortunate captive is accompanied by a Christian (al-ʿarel), who it seems is the one who will force him to return to his country and be imprisoned should he fail to raise the remainder of the ransom. The addressees are reminded of the great reward that awaits those who assist such captives. (Information in part from Goitein's index card and CUDL.) Joins: Alan Elbaum"

Rāḍī and Ṭāhir may have held their portion of the partnership jointly, and Rāḍī seems to have been the managing partner. Rāḍī attests to having paid out seventeen dinars’ worth of hides to Mufaḍḍal, leaving him (Rāḍī) owing three dinars. Lieberman thus infers that Mufaḍḍal’s share of twenty dinars represents roughly one-third of the total value of the partnership. Prior litigation on the same matter in an Islamic court led to a ruling requiring Rāḍī to pay Mufaḍḍal 1.5 dinars each month. Rāḍī seems not to have accepted the ruling, and while Mufaḍḍal seems to have been willing to compromise and accept only one dinar a month, Rāḍī brings ""an Islamic document"" to challenge him.

Yosef was asked why he sued his brother in the Muslim courts, and he said that he demanded from Hillel multiple times that he return the female slave and take his 14 dinars back.

Yiṣḥaq al-Andalusi, Jerusalem, to his partner Abū Yaʿqūb Yosef b. ʿEli ha-Kohen Fāsī, Fustat, ca. 1052. This was Avraham's first sojourn in Jerusalem. He was anxious not to have received word from Yosef for a long time, but just now encountered a Maghribi who came from the West on the same boat as Yosef, and showed Avraham some letters he brought from Yosef. Avraham was saddened to hear of Yosef's financial loss with Barhūn [b. Mūsā al-Taherti]. He thanks Yosef for concening himself with the sale of the garments. ""But here we cannot wear more than patched, flax garments, for the land is 'exhausted from the events' and neither stores nor houses are open."" (Gil glosses 'li-l-aḥdāth kalāl' as due to armed bands roving the country and notes that Chapira translated it as 'the farmers are wretched.') ""As for what you asked regarding my situation here and whether I am making a living, the land is dead; its people are poor and dead, especially in Jerusalem; no one slaughters an animal either on a weekday or on the sabbath, and there is no fowl to be had. It is very cold, and God willing I will depart after the small fast."" He asks Yosef to use part of the 10 dinars to purchase for Avraham's orphan cousin (bint khālatī) two scarfs (miʿjarayn), one blue and one green, and a mantle (mandīl) for a Torah scroll, and to send them with Barhūn—or with anybody else—to Qayrawān. He asks Yosef, for the sake of the ʿaṣabiyya between them, to look after the dukkān and take Avraham's place there. He sends regards to Isḥāq, Mūsā, Avraham al-Kohen, and Nahray. He especially sends his congratulations to Nahray on recovering from the illness that he contracted in Barqa. Here, at the end of the letter (v15–19), Avraham recounts that he was desperately ill, bedbound for one month in Ramla and for even longer in Jerusalem, but he recovered, barukh gomel le-ḥayavim ṭovot. No one had any hope for his recovery, neither he nor those around him. (This is also how Chapira understood ""mā ṭamaʿa binā aḥad lā anā wa-lā man ʿindī"" and ""mā ṭamaʿa lanā aḥad bi-l-ḥayā."" Gil seems mistaken in reading this as an idiom for ""let no one be envious of us,"" because it is a common trope in Geniza narratives of critical illness to emphasize how everyone had despaired.) Yosef would not even credit it if Avraham told him how much money he had lost from the time he left the dukkān to the present moment. He concludes again with greetings to the same friends as before, and to their families, and to Abū Zikrī Yehuda. The address is in Arabic script: to Fusṭāṭ, to al-Maʿārij (?), at the gate of Dār al-Birka. There follow at least four (Muslim) names of the deliverers. ASE."

The parnasim do not find any way to pay him this sum, and therefore it is decided to lease him the compound of the qodesh in the b. Khabisa lane for two years, for 5 dinars a year. The four parnasim receive permission to do this from Isaac ha-Kohen b. Haggay, who was apparently a member of the court, the whole community being witness to the act of lease. The compound seems to be Dar Sumana. Some special stipulation was added regarding the hikr, probably stating which of the two parties had to pay it. The verso, which was probably written two years later, includes a declaration, which apparently definitively absolves the qodesh from payment of the last five dinars still due to Yaʿaqov b. Mevasser.

Aharon b. al-'Ammani (Alexandria) to Abu l-Majd Meir b. Yakhin (Fustat). The first part (r.6-17) deals with exchanges of piyyutim between the two cantors. “You mention that the dirges have arrived and that you have everything. That is impossible. Had you said 'I have one out of ten,' all right; but that you have all of them is impossible, for some of them were composed [meaning recently] by my uncle Zadok—may his Rock keep him"" (Med Soc V, 179, 556). Yehuda also conveys the news that Abu l-Majd's brother Sa'id was very ill but has now recovered, while Abu l-Majd's mother and his brother Hilal are well. The remainder of the original letter (r.18-v.12) is a recommendation for the bearer, the Maghrebi Moshe b. Khalifa who arrived in Alexandria at least a year and a half prior and who was blinded by an eye disease and a failed operation. For two months after the operation, he suffered elevated pulse (? צרבאן) and ""saw dreadful things in his soul"" (? אבצר אלעטאים פי רוחה), and today he remains like a dumb stone. He has dependents including a wife, a virgin daughter, and a 6-month old son. The community has supported them for a year and a half, but the pesiqah no longer suffices, and his own relatives in Alexandria are unable to provide for him. Moshe carries another letter with signatures from ""the Judge""; Sadoq the cantor; Bu Sa'id b. Alqash; Bu 'Umar al-Levi b. al-Baghdadi; Yehuda himself; Bu 'Imran b. Ghulayb; R. Simha ha-Kohen; and Eliyyahu the Judge. There is a postscript (v.16-20) written two days after the original letter, when Yehuda heard that Abu l-Majd's wife is dangerously ill. He prays that he will hear of her recovery soon. There is a second postscript (v.21-24) noting that Moshe cannot travel at the present moment because he would be required to pay the capitation tax twice, but that Abu l-Majd should take care of him whenever he does arrive. Ashtor misread the date as 1400+168 by the Seleucid calendar (1257 CE), while it is in fact 4800+168=4968 since Creation (1208 CE).

(Information from Mediterranean Society, II, pp. 504-505, App. C 126)"
4532,List or table,"communal, poverty, charity, recipients, gift of money","List. Fragment (in the same script and arrangement as T-S 20.112 (PGPID 4576), T-S 24.76 (PGPID 4578), and ENA NS 13.22 (PGPID 12708)), containing the names of 51 households, at least 15 of which are identical with T-S 24.76. Legible items: 17 receive 10 (dirham=dirhams), total 85; 17 receive 10 (dirh), total 170; 9 receive 15 (dirh), total 135; 4 receive 20 (dirh), total 80; 1 receive 25 (dirh), total 25, 1 receive 30 (dirh), total 30; a total of 49 receive a total of 525 dirh. The basic unit allotted to one person clearly was 5 dirhams, as evident from such items as 'the man from Malij and his mother-10,' 'the daughter of Nissim and his mother-10,' 'the two women from Ramla-10' (see T-S K15.97; T-S J1.34). In several lists the number 1 or 2 is written after the amounts of 10, 15, 20. The number could hardly mean a simple additional payment (since then the writer would have changed the number 15 to 16 or 17, respectively); it must have had some other meaning. Had the sheet been preserved to the length of the contemporary T-S 24.76 (also only a fragment) and the sums distributed on the lost part of approximately the same size, the communal expenditure on this charity (presumably doles for a holiday) would have approximated 1,500 dirhams. Even assuming the lowest value of the dirham at this period (Mediterranean Society, I, p. 371, sec. 8) this sum would correspond to about 37 dinars, twice as much as the distribution of bread in T-S Misc.8.25 during one month.

(Ammar) Madini (of Palermo) and Abu Zikri (Yahya) b. Menashshe (see Bodl. d79.35). The donations were probably for helping the poor with their capitation tax (see T-SK15.94v).

4534,List or table,"communal, poverty, charity, donors","Contributions to a collection of loaves of bread for the poor, ranging from 100 pounds (a qintar) down to 1/2 pound. Instead of bread, one person gives three dirhams. Most of the contributors of larger amounts are introduced with the title 'my lord the elder,' while most of those giving small ones are simply called by name, such as: Yaʿaqov-1/2, Ibrahim Ibn al-Mawazini (maker of scales)-1, the oil-makers-1, the Karaite-1/2. No consistency, however, was observed in this distinction. The donors of the third and fourth largest amounts (25 and 10 pounds, respectively) receive no title, while others giving only two pounds do. The handwriting of this much-effaced document is of the calligraphic type used in books, which is extremely difficult to locate and date. Reason: The list is headed by Abu Zikri (taking him as son of Eliyyahu the dayyan, who was a prominent physician in Alexandria), while R. Yeshu'a is second, even though he donated only 4 pounds 'The haver' is also listEd. All three are conspicuous in T-S 10J16.6, the complaint of the administrator of the quppa in Alexandria, who was threatened with death when he retained certain quantities of wheat in order to meet emergencies in time of scarcity. The Nagid might have asked that all the relevant lists connected with the breadbasket of the community be submitted to him, one of which (the present list) would have finally made its way into the Geniza. If the above reasoning is correct, the document should be dated ca. 1230. (Information from Mediterranean Society, II, 491-492, App. C 53 and from Cohen)"

The interesting fact to be learned from this note is the speediness with which the pledges were collected. There are only four days between the Day of Atonement and the beginning of the Feats of Tabernacles. The letter seems to assume that, say, on the third day of the interval between the two holidays most of the pledges had already come in. Another interesting point is the Nagid's admonition to think of the poor on the Siyyum (Heb.), the festive conclusion of the yearly reading of the Pentateuch, which takes place at the end of the autumn holidays.

The physician of the hospital here is the al-Sadid of T-S K.149. Arabic was used here no doubt because the originator of the collection was a merchant who was accustomed to corresponding in Arabic rather than in Hebrew script. He also arranged collections in two noted bourses of Fustat (two collections in each bourse), one, the dar al-Fadil, founded by al-Fadil al-Baysani, originally a Fatimid official, but later chancellor and confidant of Saladin, and dar al-Za'fran (saffron house), which was adjacent to the house of gems, repeatedly mentioned in Mediterranean Society (Information from Mediterranean Society, II, p. 508, App. C 139)"

In five places dr, dirham, is added after the numerals, but dirhams are intended throughout, since the postscript actually has lil-ruqa'i, 'to the trader of orders of payments,' the banker with whom the community used to deal and who was prepared to accept these orders. The numerals in the postscript are Coptic, but conform with the Hebrew numerals in the main list, as far as preserved: 19 households receive 73~ dirhams. A number of characteristic names are identical with those occurring in B 17-24. Note specifically: a European (ifranji) who lives in the synagogue--2...a poor young man who arrived in the evening and whose overcoat, kisa, was taken from him as a collateral for 5 dirhams; his name is Abu al-Muna, he is sick; Mu'ammala ('the one hoped for'), a widow of good family, who never in her life had taken anything from anyone--5. The whole seems to be a distribution of money, probably before a holiday, in a time of severe hardship, when the community had not enough means, and about fifty families had to wait for their shares. Even then about one-third received their allocations in orders of payments--and we do not know how much the ruqai charged for converting them into cash.

List of indigent people equally divided between natives of the capital and residents originating from Alexandria, the Sharqiyya and Gharbiyya provinces, the villages around the capital (all entirely destitute), and towns such as Ashmum, Damietta, and Qūṣ. The document refers to three groups with different capacities to pay the capitation tax: (1) those who cannot afford to pay anything, (2) those who can afford to pay 2 dīnārs, but only in instalments and (3) the remainder, from whom 4 dīnārs should be exacted. Khan notes that Rabie (The Financial System of Egypt, 109–10) overlooked the last line of the list, which refers to the payment of 4 dīnārs. Rabie therefore concluded that the document reflected the payment of a flat rate of capitation tax at 2 dīnārs per head. Khan argues that there was variation in the rate of capitation tax in different historical periods (commentary to T-S H15.62, Khan, Arabic Legal and Administrative Documents in the Cambridge Genizah Collections, doc. 89, and commentary to this document, ibid., doc. 136): at the beginning of the Ayyubid period, the rates were fixed at 4⅙ dīnārs, 2 1/12 dīnārs and 1⅝ dīnārs. In the middle of the Ayyubid period, the high and intermediate rates were rounded down to 4 dīnārs and 2 dīnārs. Toward the end of the Ayyubid period, a flat rate of 2 dīnārs was introduced.

In any event, this notation seems to have been there before the list was written, as proved by the last name on line 10, Sulayman, which had to be squeezed in to avoid the letters in the margin, and by the fact that the note is seemingly in a different hand. If so, the writing in the margin probably has nothing to do with the list and therefore the list is to be dated after the fall of 1335.

Details about 44 plus 37 households are recorded, but the leaf, which is folded to form a booklet of four pages, is superscribed 'Leaf no. 3', so that the total number of persons listed originally might have been not 81, but three times as many.

II, l. 15; col. IV, l. 6), is listed as recipient of a thawb, or gown, in the first distribution (col. I, l. 20 [read: 10]), where, however, the item is crossed out. This could hardly mean here, as in some other documents, that the garment had already been delivered to him, for about forty items, or half the total contained in this leaf, exhibit the Arabic final mem, which Goitein takes as an abbreviation of (tasalla)m, 'received' (the same in Appendix B 33, 64, and C 41). Thus the deletion of the parnas share probably had another reason. Other parnasim, mostly outsiders, or their relatives, receive clothing, for example, 'the sister of the parnas from Jerusalem' I l. 18, 'the firnas of Damietta' I:31, 'the parnas of Crete' II:6 (also crossed out), also II:1, IV:1 and 5.

Actual payments were made once for several weeks. The insertion in small letters of 'Thursday' between lines 18 and 19 shows that R.

Goitein's solution: 'There still were two distributions every week, on Tuesdays and Fridays, as had been the practice a hundred and more years before. Our list notes the number of loaves allocated to each household for one distribution (habitual in all lists of the poor), but registers the total spent on bread during one week (by the distributor concerned).

It was no doubt prepared in order to form the basis for weekly distribution of bread to the needy and to community officials. The names of the assistant judge Jephthah, the beadle Tahir, and the cantor Abu Sahl put the list at the beginning of the thirteenth century, preferably after T-S NS J.98, where Tahir receives 14 loaves, indicating that he still had a large household, whereas here only one child lives with him, and a son of his is listed as a separate family. The average size of a family of relief recipients is 2.4. For a realistic appreciation of this breakdown one should keep in mind that most of the persons listed must have been elderly people who either no longer had a family or whose older children (from the age of ten) were seeking their livelihood out of their homes.

4727,Letter,"India, IB3","Letter from Avraham Ibn Yiju, in Fustat, to his brother, Yosef, in Mazara, Sicily. Dating: September 1153 (Goitein) or 1152 (Friedman). It appears that Ibn Yijū and Yosef had fallen out of direct touch, but he wants to renew contact and, not unrelated to that, to propose marrying their children to one another. (1) Ibn Yijū says he has heard that Yosef has three sons, and he explains in a very moving passage that he himself had two sons in India (tender? pleasant? ""as the twigs of sweet basil"" but both died in childhood. (2) Ibn Yijū then turns to the matter of his daughter: while Khalaf b. Bundār, the wealthy trader in Aden, wanted his son to marry her, Ibn Yijū preferred her to marry her cousin Surūr, who was not wealthy, and who was a refugee from Ifrīqiya to Mazara. Says Ibn Yijū: ""My brother’s son is more deserving (of her) than strangers.” Goitein often quoted this line to argue for a preference for endogamy and cousin-marriage, but Krakowski persuasively argues (Coming of Age, 218–21) that this situation is too specific to be generalizable: Ibn Yijū seems to want, instead, to use cousin marriage ""not to affirm and reify existing social loyalties, but to create an essentially new connection between socially distant relatives"" (221). But Ibn Yijū's explicit motive is different: he says he wants his future son-in-law to be ""learned in Torah"" (r12), and he's heard from both their other brother, Mevasser, and the Sicilian merchants in Aden and Fustat said that Surūr fits the bill. (3) The complicated relationship between the two brothers — in some ways a classic older/younger sibling dynamic — emerges clearly when Ibn Yijū alternately turns on the charm, perhaps to sweeten the marriage proposal, and scolds his brother. He explains that he's sent him a mixture of pepper and ginger, but then he admonishes him for losing a previous gift of pepper ""through incompetence"" (bi-ʿajzika, r31); he asks his brother not only to write back to him, but cheekily adds that he should send Surūr to Fustat with the letters; and then he explains that if it weren't for the departure of the ships westward with the Salībiyya winds (late September, so-called after the Coptic Feast of the Cross on 26–27 September), he would have sent further gifts for him and his sons. (4) He then complains about their other, good-for-nothing brother, Mevasser, describing him as ""indolent"" and ""hard of heart"" and blaming him for his own financial losses. (5) Then follows the usual litany of greetings to your two (crossed out) three sons, their mother, their sister Berākha, her children, her husband, Marwān, their children again; to the otherwise unattested Barhūn b. Ḥassūn b. ʿAṭiyya, who is connected with Ibn Yijū's (other?) sister; to R. Moses ""the great cantor."" On the dating of the letter: Goitein dates the document to September 1153 because this letter was written from Egypt, and Goitein believes Ibn Yijū to have traveled from Aden to Cairo in spring or summer 1153, while the reference to the Salībiyya winds indicates that this letter was written in September — hence September 1153; Friedman, however, believes that Ibn Yijū arrived in Egypt in 1152, and indeed, at r22, Ibn Yijū explains that his daughter had been engaged to the son of Khalaf b. Bundār in Aden for three years, while we know from IB III,29 that they had arrived in Aden in fall 1149. MR"

It appears that the question involved a betrothal that was carried out with haste (see line 3) by an inexperienced man. The respondent expresses his displeasure that the betrothal was conducted by someone who was not 'experienced in the matter of marriage and divorce' and requests to know how exactly the marriage was conducted: were the objects of betrothal handed directly to the bride or her representatives, and were those appointed in front of two witnesses?

4754,Legal document,engagement,"Engagement agreement from 1184. The date of marriage was set for the month of Elul in the following year, almost two years after the document was composed. The bride was orphaned from her father and there is no mention of a representative on her behalf as is common in many engagement agreements. This might indicate that she represented herself and that she was mature. However, the fact that two year would elapse before the marriage can take place might indicate that she was still rather young; see Goitein, Med. Soc. Vol. 3, pp. 92. } The father of the groom vows to take care of all the bride's expenses for five years after the marriage. It is possible that the groom was too young and the bride's family was concerned that he would be unable to provide sufficiently for the bride and thus sought to place this responsibility on his father. There is no mention of any fine on either party in the event that the marriage will not take place. Most of the contract is written in Aramaic and Hebrew but the conditions prevalent at the time in Egypt were written in Arabic and perhaps this indicates that they originated in the surrounding Muslim environment (in ENA NS 21.6 there are conditions in both Arabic and Hebrew and Friedman suggests that the conditions that have not yet won wider acceptance were written in Arabic; see Friedman, Polygyny, pp. 56-59)."

Nuʿmān ha-Kohen, also known as Sitt al-ʿItra. Lines 11-12 set a date for the marriage (before Nisan of the current year), meaning the deed was written prior to the wedding day. The agreement is presented in the first person reducing the probability that it is a betrothal agreement. The fact that the document refers to the bride as 'mumallaka' (betrothed or his fiancee; fiancee is more probable) shows that the agreement was made after the engagement took place. It is possible that during the engagement no agreement was written or that the agreement was not comprehensive and therefore this agreement was written. Despite the fact that the manuscript is incomplete it is probable that the bride represented herself, despite the fact that her father was alive: the groom testifies that he handed over to the bride the money directly. Moreover, there is no mention of a representative of the bride. The document has not been published or mentioned elsewhere. Joins: Amir Ashur (CUL Or.1081 J34 + ENA 4011.14) and Alan Elbaum (the AIU piece). (Information mainly from Ashur's dissertation, with adjustments based on new information from AIU VII.D.110.)"

The Responsum asks: May the husband force his wife to join him against her will? If the answer is no, must he divorce her, as he transgressed an explicit condition in her Ketubba? If the answer to both questions is negative, must he give her child support while he is away? Must he only provide for his kids in this period? The answer has not been preservEd.

Goitein (Med. Soc. 3:127) suggests that the deed was written around 1130, but does not explain the basis for this dating. The earliest identified ketubba that contain the monogamy condition as found here is from 1117, thus the deed was probably written after that year. Deed A, Ketubba: Ashur inserted this ketubba to his dissertation, which does not usually treats ketubbot, because of its proximity to the other deed and due to the unusual condition it contains. The husband vows to provide his wife with a female slave and, in case the present slave dies, to replace her with a new one. It is probable that Ḥalfon copied this condition from a real ketubba, since it is unlikely that this condition was common enough to be included in a manual of deeds. Deed B: deed complementing the Ketubba. Deed which records the dowry that was not stated in the ketubba.

The two manuscripts contain the bride's consent to the marriage, her receiving the initial marriage gift (Muqaddam) and an appoint of a representative on her behalf. The first manuscript, ENA NS I.95a, from the 3rd of Nissan (Monday, the 14th of March) year 1244, is a testimony of witnesses that the bride gave in their presence her consent to the marriage to the aforementioned Groom, and that she received the initial marriage gift (Muqaddam) and accepted the sum of the delayed marriage gift (Me'ukhar). The story takes an unexpected twist in the second manuscript dated two days afterward. While the wife testified in the previous document that she received the initial marriage gift and accepted the sum of the delayed marriage gift, in the second document she appoints her brother to receive the initial marriage gift and to set the sum of the delayed marriage gift. Since the ending of the first document did not survive it is impossible to determine what took place in those two days. The wife might have wanted to testify that she received the muqaddam but things did not turn out the way they should have (the two sides might have fallen into dispute and the agreement was not signed?) Thus, direct involvement of the bride's wife was required. Another option is that the brother's appointment as representative was carried out informally before receiving the initial marriage gift, but only later was this formalized in court.

It is possible that the agreement reflects special circumstances: the marriage is mentioned in future tense and since there are no betrothal deeds in which the time of marriage is set, it must be assumed that this is a general Prenuptial agreement. However, due to the lacunas in the text it is difficult to ascertain the exact unfolding of events. The condition which forbids the husband to have sexual intercourse (with his wife? With the servant?) is especially intriguing."

Bareket notes that there are fragments of his legal writings in the Geniza and suggests that these were collections of responsa (Bareket, Jewish Leadership, 120). The many amendments in the manuscript suggests that this is an answer he has composed himself, thus providing further confirmation to Bareket's suggestion that he used to compose responsa literature. It is hard to understand the nature of the responsum at hand due to its state, but it seems like it deals with a woman who appointed her sister's husband as a representative for the marriage. It appears that she sought to re-marry her previous husband while her brother-in-law agreed to a marriage with another man. The woman claimed that she did not intend to appoint him as her representative and that there were no witnesses to such an appointment. The Rabbi decided that the marriage to the other man were invalid and the woman may marry her previous husband. If the marriage to the other man had been conducted she would have been forbidden by Jewish Law to her previous husband This manuscript should be added to the corpus of manuscripts of Efrayim b.

Dated: Sunday, 4 Nisan 1552 Seleucid, which is 1241 CE. Fiancé: Surūr b. Yiṣḥaq al-Iskandarānī. Fiancée: Karam bt. Yefet. #2: Abū Manṣūr b. Faḍāʾil declares that he owes Ṣadiq b. Moshe [the entry ends here]. #3 (at 180 degrees): Something concerning Rashīda bt. Abū l-ʿIzz ha-Levi (""al-Rayyis al-Ajall"") and monthly payments of 20 wariq dirhams. There follows what may be another entry, mainly in Arabic script. (Information in part from Ashur's edition of #1.)"
4765,Legal document,"prenuptial, contract","Legal document concerning a marriage contract, bridal gifts and rights to a property, mentioning the name Abū Saʿd. (Information from CUDL.) A general prenuptial agreement. The hand recalls the hand of Natan ha-Kohen b. Shelomo, but it is probably written by a different scribe. The document appears to be a draft, or a template for a prenuptial agreement, since it is missing important details, like the name of the bride. Similarly, the ending 'and peace' was common in letters and not in legal documents, and may suggest that the template was sent to one of the sides after they requested to preview it. It is also possible that a Rabbi or the conductor of the marriage sent it to a higher legal authority to obtain his approval. "
4766,Legal document,"prenuptial, contract","Prenuptial agreement of a previously divorced couple (a husband who re-accepts his divorcée). Eight lines survive on this fragment, probably in the hand of Natan b. Shemuel ha-Ḥaver (documents by him in the years 1128-1153). In the top of the fragment there is a dowry list followed by a list of conditions in Hebrew for future marriage. The husband reaccepts his previous wife, Baqiya. It is possible that this agreement was written to pacify the woman so that she will return to her husband. The conditions regarding his behavior suggest that his violent behavior towards her, or her mother, was the cause of their initial divorce. Lines 1-4 contain the dowry list, and are not transcribed."
4767,Legal document,"Halfon b. Menashshe, prenuptial, contract","Fragment of a general prenuptial agreement in the hand of Ḥalfon b. Menashshe ha-Levi. The agreement contains remarkable conditions that favor the woman: the bride demanded to live separately from her husband's sisters. In addition, the husband vows to behave well toward his wife and not to beat her. The husband also vows not to forbid the wife from leaving the home. The wife received as a gift a part of her mother's house and the husband vows that her mother will be allowed to live with them. The husband must transfer the rent paid for his wife's share of her mother's house to his mother-in-law for five years. The wife may do as she pleases with her wealth and the husband has no right to it. There is also a special condition that specifies that the groom must provide any medical and burial expenses for his mother-in-law."
4768,Legal document,"betrothal, prenuptial, contract","A general prenuptial agreement in the hand of Natan ha-Kohen b. Shelomo. Goitein suggests that this document was written before 1134, the year that Ṣedaqa al-Ramli, the grandfather of the bride, passed away (Med. Soc. 3:154). The agreement was held between the groom and the father of the bride and there is no mention that she appointed her father as her representative or any expression of her consent. In addition, the time of marriage is not set and it is possible that this matter has been decided earlier or was subject to later negotiations. In addition, the deed is without dates or signatures, which are usually found in deeds of betrothal or engagement. Perhaps this is a general agreement appended to another agreement or it might be a draft. (Translated to English in Goitein, 3:154. Med. Soc.). Alternate description: betrothal deed between R. Efrayim ha-Talmid b. Meshullam and Yeshuʿa b. Ṣedaqa ha-Levi al-Ramlī for his daughter Sitt al-Fakhr. The advanced gift is 15 dinars, the delayed gift 50 dinars (though 60 is written above the line). (Information from CUDL)"
4769,Legal document,Marriage,"Dowry deed from Fustat, 1171 CE. It was customary to bring together all the objects of the dowry and to record them publicly in a trousseau list, as can be seen, for example, in document T-S Ar.54.78. Each object was recorded with its value in a special list and such lists were called taqwīm. The deed at hand is not a taqwīm, but rather a 'dowry deed'. Such deeds were composed at times of political unrest, when the two sides were cautious of making financial commitmants in public. This is why one often finds in such deeds the expression 'due to the time (ʿawāqib al-zamān)' seen here in lines 3 and 20. The deed, scribed by Mevorakh b. Natan (1150-1181), contains the trousseau list and the testimony of the groom that he accepts the dowry and its stated value. The manuscript is cut in the shape of a circle and is missing some of the text in the sides. There are a few lines in Arabic script on verso."
4770,Legal document,"register, engagement, prenuptial, contract","Legal record (#43 and #44). Engagement contract, outline. Dated: Thursday, 14 Sivan 1467 Seleucid. In the hand of Meovrakh b. Natan (like the rest of the notebook). Engagement agreement between a Qaraite man (Abū Saʿīd) and a Rabbanite woman (Sitt al-Naṣr bt. Netan'el ha-Kohen). Goitein suggests that it is an agreement between a husband and wife that was composed after a quarrel (Med. Soc. 3:152–53). But Ashur judges the document to be an engagement agreement because the early marriage payment (muqaddam) is mentioned and there is a condition that the muqaddam will be considered 'a gift', alongside many other conditions common in agreements before the marriage. These conditions include: not to bring into the house anything forbidden by the Rabbanites (ṭā'ifat al-rabbānīn), that the early marriage payment is a gift, that he will not marry a second wife nor take a concubine if she disapproves, on pain of having to pay the delayed marriage payment and giving her a divorce, etc. NB: Goitein and Ashur referred to this document as folio 17 (Firk. II NS 1700.17) in accordance with the foliation written in pen; but the correct folio is 18, as written in pencil (the librarian with the pen gave two folios the number 8). ASE."
5198,Letter,communal,"Letter discussing communal matters, especially income derived from the market place by religious dignitaries.

Avraham b. David, 'the joy of the yeshiva', might refer to Avraham b. David b. Sighmar mentioned with this title in ENA2804.11 (Goitein, Med.Soc.3:183). The letter also mentions the Nasi and ends with profuse expressions of submission. Goitein suggests that the references to the Nasi and the Yeshiva indicate that the letter originated in Fustat (Goitein, Med. Soc., 2:543 note 3). On the verso, there are four lines of greetings possibly in a different hand. This is probably a draft and unconnected to the contents of the recto. Similar expressions are found in other Geniza letters, such as T-S NS 320.9 (Gil, Palestine, 2:388, doc. #211)."

5224,Letter,"Badr al-Jamali, amir al-juyush, Berber, Lawata","Letter. Fragment refers to someone designated as 'the elevated presence.' Verso of the letter mentions the murder of Fakhr al-ʾUmara near Alexandria and also mentioning ʾAmīr al-Jūyūsh, which was the title of Badr al-Jamālī, the Armenian general and actual ruler of Egypt, 1074-1094 (see Cohen, Jewish Self-Government, pg. 61-65). Fakhr al-ʾUmara was a title of the viziers of the sword (arbāb al-sūyūf) and was third in the ranks of such viziers (see al-Qalqashandī, Ṣubḥ al-Āʿashā, pg. 104). The vizier in question could be the brother of Nāṣir al-Dawla who was the Turkish military commander during the time of the Fatimid Caliph al-Mustanṣir Billah. He (Fakhr al-ʾUmara) is also referred to as Sulṭān al-ʿArab in some historical sources (see ʿImāduddīn, ʿŪyūn al-Akhbār, vol. 7, pg. 61-65). He was assassinated by Badr al-Jamālī, among other rebels, including Nāṣir al-Dawla, upon entering Egypt for their insurgents and rebels against the state which caused political unrest in the country for almost a decade (1062-1072). While Badr al-Jamālī was restoring law and order in Egypt and assassinating the rebels, many factions of the rebel army and clans surrendered to him to avoid persecution. This letter mentions Badr al-Jamālī receiving such letters from the Lawāta Berbers and other clans, as well as a delegation from Sulaymān (the name demands further inquiry). The letter also mentions (Ibn?) Hamūd, also Ibn Hamdān or Ibn Hamdūn, (the name appears with variations in historical sources) I.e., the name of Nāṣir al-Dawla as giving an account of these events. Badr al-Jamālī entered Egypt in 467/1075, hence this letter could be dated to that year. (ASE, YU)"

In Judaeo-Arabic. Frenkel identifies the writer's location as Alexandria, the addressee as Ismāʿīl al-Fāṣid, and the date as 1176 CE, but does not seem to explain her reasoning. The letter recounts an interesting family saga. The addressee's maternal uncle passed away while traveling with the addressee to India. The addressee took care of him before his death. The family has taken great pains to conceal the news of the uncle's death until they receive a detailed account of his will. This long letter repeatedly describes everyone's anxiety waiting for news of the addressee's health and the will. His mother, when she heard of the death of her brother and the news of the addressee's difficulties at sea, fell sick and fasted until news came of the addressee's health. His father stays up all night praying for him. ""If you knew how much reward (in Heaven) you receive from every letter you write us, you would do nothing but write us letters."" The family congratulates the addressee on his purchase of a male slave (ghulām). Finally, the reason for the anxiety about the will comes to light at the end. The uncle knew or thought that his wife was pregnant when he departed, however, they counted 9 months, and there was no baby. They counted another 9 months, and she had a baby boy. The family evidently wishes to ensure that none of the uncle's inheritance ends up with his wife or son. Even the Muslims say, ""We have never heard anything like what this Jewish woman has done. She deserves nothing but hellfire."" The widow was able to round up some allies from among the Byzantine Jews, and they managed to gather 10 Jews for the circumcision, but with no cantor or judge present. In the midst of sending everyone's regards in the margin of verso, the writer reports sarcastically that the newborn infant also sends his.

The letter mentions one of the most famous jurists of Alexandria, the faqīh Ibn ʿAwf. Frenkel identifies this man with the Mālikī jurist Abū Ṭāhir Ismāʿīl b. Makkī b. ʿĪsā b. ʿAwf of Alexandria (d. 1188), who was one of Saladin's teachers. The same faqīh is also mentioned in T-S 12.290 and T-S 16.272.

They have been in Bilbays only a brief time, since 17 Iyyar, seeking a living there because of difficult economic conditions in Alexandria. But this project has not worked out, and so they are planning to return to Alexandria. The main purpose of the letter is to ask Eliyyahu to rebuke another Abū l-Faraj, who owes the writer 18 dinars, and force him to pay. The writer had deposited the money (and other goods) with this Abū l-Faraj on the night before he traveled; this was witnessed by another cousin (ibn khāla) of Eliyyahu, Manṣūr b. Sahlān. The writer told Abū l-Faraj to draw up a contract for the deposit/loan, but he never did so. (Probably he is now denying that he owes anything.) ""If I had known that the matter would turn out like this, {I} wouldn't have given him a penny. . . . My greatest need from you is to rebuke Abū l-Faraj, for he is a heretic [zindīq]. My only salvation from him will be through God and through you. I am shocked at how he treated my son. . . . I am now a piece of flesh: I lack money, sight, and a living."" He mentions his weak vision earlier in the letter, too, when explaining the ""delay of my raḥl (merchandise? travel?)."" Also of interest in the letter is what Abū l-Faraj conveys about his hospitality for Eliyyahu's son, the physician Abū Zikrī, who returned from Jerusalem the previous year. Initially, Abū Zikrī stayed with Abū l-Faraj the son of the Parnas. But after Yom Kippur, the writer said, ""He should stay with me instead of with strangers."" And thus they lived together, ""head to head""—apparently an expression of his great hospitality. When the writer and his son, along with Asad and Abū l-Munā, started preparing to travel (to Fustat?), they urged Abū Zikrī to come with them, citing the wishes of Eliyyahu, but he refused. Asad ended up advancing him 17 dirhams for the capitation tax. Abū Zikrī has no intention of coming, but rather is staying in the house of the writer, along with Sulaymān the Yemeni (perhaps the father of Avraham b. Shelomo the Yemeni, who lived with Abū Zikrī in Jerusalem, and who had family in Bilbays, see T-S 8J16.3 and T-S 13J21.5). Abū Zikrī's motivations seem in part financial—he says he will not come until his father sends him 10 dinars.

Sadoq the Judge, crediting Avraham with resolving it. He describes the scene of the ṣulḥa in which all the family members drank to each other's health (Med Soc V, 39). Yehudah continues (v.19-31) with an encomium to Avraham; the Alexandrians have been praying and fasting for God to lift the epidemic that has attacked the population of Fustat and to protect Avraham specifically. Yehuda then emphasizes with gestures of humility (v.31-49) that all the affairs of the community rest on his shoulders alone, as his uncle drinks all day long. Yehuda's temperament cannot tolerate wine—he quotes Proverbs 20:1 (""whosoever reeleth thereby is not wise"")—and does not drink more than a quarter cup in a sitting and certainly never becomes drunk.

5302,Letter,,"Letter from Mubārak/Mevorakh b. Yiṣḥaq, in Alexandria, to his father-in-law, Abū l-Ḥasan Surūr b. Ḥayyim Ibn Sabra, in Fustat. Dating: ca. 1060s CE according to Frenkel, though the basis for this is unclear. The sender has been in Alexandria for the last month and intends to spend the winter there, even though the addressee had urged him not to. He says that the times are just as difficult in Alexandria as they are in Fustat; bread currently costs a dirham for two ounces. Barhūn Ibn al-Tāhertī arrived from Sunbāṭ and reported that he and his family are safe (the original danger is unspecified), having lost only the furnishings of their house and his servants (khadam), whom he know hopes to redeem (iftikāk). He reports that ""your daughter is well, crying due to what she hears about you."" This letter is being sent with Abū l-Ḥusayn Hārūn b. Yeshuʿa al-Tinnīsī the friend of ʿAbd al-Bāqī al-ʿAṭṭār. The sender has asked him to obtain some things for him in Fustat; even the clothes they are wearing is borrowed, because clothes cannot be bought in Alexandria. He orders many specific items of clothing to be sent back with the bearer Abū l-Ḥusayn. He says that he misses the addressee and feels such estrangement (ghurba) that sometimes when he eats and he thinks about the addressee and the lack of letters from him, the taste of the food is spoiled or he gets nauseated (atanaghghaṣ li-dhālik). He doesn't know anyone in Alexandria, even though everyone honors him, except for Wuhayb the cantor who ignores the sender even when he greets him."
5303,Letter,bialphabetic,"Verso: Letter in Arabic script. Dating: possibly late 11th century, based on Frenkel's identification of the addressee. An unidentified sender wrote this letter to a friend in Alexandria, urging him to send him a poem (qaṣīda) the latter composed. The sender, himself a cantor and lover of poetry, copies out half of a comical Hebrew poem of his, written in praise of Abū l-Faraj Hiba of the Ibn Naḥum family. Frenkel identifies the sender as Avraham b. Sahlān (b. Avraham b. Sahlān) the descendant of Sunbāṭ, i.e., the grandson of the Avraham b. Sahlān who was the head of the Babylonian congregation in Fustat until the year 1030. However, the abbreviation נבע appears after Avraham's name, indicating that he is deceased, and this would also be an unusual place for the sender of a letter to sign his name. Goitein suggests that the sender could be Yoshiyya b. Neḥemya b. Avraham b. Sahlān b. Avraham b. Sahlān b. Avraham b. Shelomo b. Shabbat/Sunbāṭ, whose genealogy is given on BL OR 5557A.47–58, at fols. 51r and 57v/58r (cited in Mann, Jews, vol. II, 101–02), but this too seems difficult to prove. (Information in part from Frenkel and Goitein's index card.)"
5304,Letter,"communal, Petition","Letter from the Alexandrian community to Shemuel ha-Levi, ""the prince of Levites, the glory of doctors"" b. Shelomo, requesting his help in countering a decree that forbade saying piyyutim (Heb. sacred poetry) during prayer. Goitein argued that the letter was written from a country town in Egypt while Friedman suggested that the letter originated from the Jerusalemite Synagogue in Fustat and that the decree forbidding piyyutim was part of the Hasidic reforms of prayer which Avraham Maimonides tried to implement. In Frenkel's opinion, the letter was sent from Alexandria. There are a few indications for this in the letter: The mentioning of 'the evils of gentiles' (recto - line 17) fits well with Alexandria which was known for its fanatic atmosphere and for its not uncommon anti-Jewish acts of violence; see Goitein, Med. Soc. 2:278-281. The same is true for the mention of an epidemic lung disease common to Alexandria (recto, right margin line 1 and the note to this line). Furthermore, Alexandria was known for its characteristic prayer customs, to which the Alexandrian Jewish community adhered with zeal; see for example the responsa sent by Saadya b. Berakhot ha-Melammed from Alexandria to Maimonides (Maimonides, Responsa, vol. 1, #113, p. 196; vol. 1, #118, p. 202; vol. 2, #163, pp. 311-312; vol. 2, #259, p. 485). Friedman's argument that the decree forbidding piyyutim originated from Avraham Maimonides fits well with the argument that the letter was sent from Alexandria. A group of pious followers (Heb. Hassidim) of Avraham Maimonides settled in Alexandria and strove to implement in the wider community the principals of their creed. The reference to these pious followers as 'judges, cantors and managers of pious foundations' (Verso, line 3) agrees with other hints about the followers of Avraham Maimonides as enjoying material benefits and neglecting their spiritual mission. On the active followers of Avraham Maimonides in Alexandria see Goitein, 'Our Rabbi Avraham,' Trabitz 33 (1964): 181-197. (Information from Frenkel.) [The suggestion that <em>barāsīm</em> refers to an epidemic lung disease is doubtful. Though the Pahlavi <em>birsām</em> originally meant ""pleurisy,"" in the Arabic medical literature, the word was used interchangeably with <em>sirsām</em>, i.e., phrenitis or delirium. Al-Razi notes that even if physicians sometimes distinguished the two terms, laypeople regarded them as fully synonymous. See Ullmann, Islamic Medicine, pp. 29-30. Both the disease and the death are metaphorical in this letter: ""O Israel, if you see that we have been ended and killed by the frenzies brought against us (by our persecutors), know that we have been killed for the sake of the rite of our fathers and grandfathers and prophets..."" It would not be a martyrdom to be killed by a disease. ASE.]"

Nissim (possibly Ibn Yiju, great-grandson of Avraham Yiju, the India trader) as investors, investing 400 and 200 dinars respectively. There is a reference to ""Arabic documents"" which record the dimensions and location of the factory, and the fact that the brothers inherited part of the factory and purchased the balance from their father. The investors allow the brothers to pursue other investments outside the partnership with partnership funds. Withdrawals from the partnership capital are recorded as a transfer of a share of the ownership from the brothers to the investors, and any rent on this share goes to the investors. The investors are required to return the partial ownership of the factory when the funds are repaid. The Arabic documents record the sale of the factory (and presumably the transfer of the shares) as a ""fixed"" purchase. The brothers remain active partners in the five-year partnership. Partnership profits are divided equally, despite the unequal investments. The brothers will account for their expenses by subtracting from partnership profits 2 dinars per molded block of sugar. Per Goitein, a document at shelfmark T-S NS J215 describes the eventual sale of the factory discussed in this document. (Information from Lieberman, ""A Partnership Culture"", 23-25)"

5349,Legal document,"India, IB1, acccount","Legal rebuttal regarding the lawsuit between Yosef Lebdi and Wuhsha over the possession of 22 bales of lac. So far, six bifolia and two leaves have been identified, totaling 28 pages of what must have been 40 pages in 2 quires. It seems that the judge in the lawsuit ruled in Lebdi's favor. A certain 'rayyis' wrote and published a critique of the ruling and supported Wuhsha's position. The judge answered with a rebuttal, and what has survived in the Geniza is the rayyis's rebuttal of the judge's rebuttal. The writer often quotes passages from his original critique and from the judge's answer. While the document is complex and obscure, the positions of the two sides are simple. The judge believed Lebdi's agreement with his two partners, Farah and Abu Nasr, includes the 22 loads of lac in question, as long as the other party does not provide proof that it does not include them. The unnamed rayyis argued that since Lebdi had no proof that the 22 bales belonged to his partnership with Farah and Abu Nasr, they must be considered as belonging to Farah's and Abu Nasr's heirs, since the bales are in their possession. In other words, since the bales are in the hands of the heirs, the burden of proof must be on Lebdi. Farah and Abu Nasr, it must be remembered, were murdered in Aydhab. Lebdi was entitled to 29 shares out of 30 of everything in their partnership and Abu Nasr and Farah had between them only one share. Farah's heirs already took their small share of the 22 bales of lac. It is worth noticing that only Wuhsha is mentioned as 'the heir' to Abu Nasr, even though we know she had another brother and two sisters. The trial between Lebdi and Wuhsha took place in 1104, three years after Lebdi came back from India, because the judge intentionally delayed the proceedings to give the parties time to come to an agreement. The last fragment, whose place in the larger document is not known, contains the information that the case was brought before a Muslim judge, who ruled in Wuhsha's favor. This document was thus written during or shortly after 1104.

Bundar) completely. Lebdi made arrangements with Bundar that he would forward the money that Lebdi and Yequtiʾel were owed. The fact that Lebdi did not settle his affairs in Aden contributed much to his current conflict with Yequtiʾel.

For a year and ten months after the sale of the house, Lebdi still owed Najiya 80 dinars for the house. Only after he returned from another successful India voyage, he could pay this debt. The three court sessions were concerned with the rents due Najiya, an issue compounded by Lebdi's claim that the rent for the ground floor was included in the 80 dinars and the fact that the subtenants claimed that they paid part of their rent by repairs and upkeep to the house.

When both Lebdi and Avraham's mother died, Avraham sought to marry Lebdi;s daughter so that he would still be tied to the great merchant's house. He came to Sitt al-Ahl's house, with two male friends and a certain prominent member of the community to try to secure the match. Lebdi's widow, Sitt al-Ahl's mother, tried to stall and wait until Sitt al-Ahl's older brother, now the man of the house, came back from his journey. Avraham, however, did not want to leave empty handed and pressured the widow to agree. Sitt al-Ahl was summoned and she agreed to the match. Avraham betrothed Sitt al-Ahl with two rings, one of gold and one of silver, and gave her five dinars. All this was done in the presence of her mother and her younger brother. The betrothal was carried out in November 1118 and the court record is from January 1120. Friedman rightly notes that the record was made after it became clear that Sitt al-Ahl was not intending to marry Avraham and, indeed, the court ruled that she is legally Avraham's wife and required a formal bill of divorce.

We can tell that this is a copy of the original document as the names of the litigants are not mentioned and the document is not signed. On the other hand, the detailed description of the entire process, the dates, the exact monetary sums, the number of rings and their type, all testify that this was a real case. Goitein suggests that the document represent an agreement made by a poor couple. This is the only document known to Ashur in which the word 'betrothals' (Shiddukhim) means both 'marriage gift' and 'consecration money' ('matnat nissu'in' and 'kesef qiddushin'). The body of the document contains two dates. The first, in the beginning of the document, refers to the date in which the groom proclaimed, in front of witnesses, his desire to marry the bride and gave them the three rings. The second date, 17 days later, is probably the date in which the engagement contract was delivered to the bride's representative (Assaf presented a different view, “ the second date is the date in which the matter was put on paper while the first date signify the time of the engagement which took place on a single day. However, Ashur objects as it was customary to clearly mention the fact that a document was signed at a later date). The Muslim year is mentioned in the beginning of the document (year 428 is equivalent to 1036 C.E) eight years after the events described in the document. Assaf, who was the first to publish the document, claimed that the date and the title 'what took place' do not belong to the rest of the document. However, Ashur claims that this date is the date in which the document was copied to the legal documents file in court and in the same occasion the title was written, since the recto also has the year recorded at the header (Assaf missed the word 'year' in the header of the recto. The process of preparing the betrothal is described in great detail which is unmatched by other Geniza documents. The groom addresses the witnesses, who act as arrangers of the betrothal and were probably sent by the court, and declares his desire to 'engage and betroth' the bride. After this declaration, he hands over three betrothals (shiddukhim') “ rings that are supposed to later serve as betrothal objects. The witnesses ask him about the sum of the marriage gift (mahr/mohar). The groom responds that when he will have the means to do so, he will hand it over to the bride or to her representative personally. From checking dozens of engagement agreements, it is clear that the sum of the marriage gift was one of the first things agreed upon by the bride and groom. It appears that the witnesses wanted to know the sum of the Mohar so they can report it to the bride or her representative, and obtain her approval to the betrothal. In the next stage, the witnesses arrive to the bride and make sure she appointed her representative. Then they handed over the rings to the bride's representative as an act of betrothal."

Yaʿaqov, in Fustat, to his in-law Abū Zikrī Kohen, in Alexandria. Dating: Sunday, 15 Jumāda = 16 Adar, which is probably 3 March 1135 CE. The letter is an urgent warning advising Abū Zikrī to take all his merchandise out of a warehouse in Alexandria. ""A business partner of Abu Zikrī's in Fustat was dying, and because of the lawlessness prevailing at that time in Egypt, Abu Zikrī's goods would be confiscated together with those of the dead man (before 1129, it seems). {The dying man, Abū Saʿīd, was related to Abu Zikrī's partner the well-known Alexandrian India trader Abu Naṣr b. Elishaʿ. Evidently, Abu Saʿīd did not have any heirs of the first degree, and the officials of the diwan al-mawārīth (line 5: aṣḥāb mawarif!), the Office of Estates, which took advantage ofsuch situations, were about to confiscate all ofhis belongings held by Abu Naṣr. Not taking any chances, the officials would sequester Abu Naṣr's assets and, moreover, those of Abū Zikrī, since the partners' holdings were stored together. The Head of the Yeshiva, certainly Maṣliaḥ ha-Kohen, who in fact was apparently Abū Zikrī's cousin, personally conveyed the warning to Maḥrūz and instructed him to send immediately an urgent message to his brother-in-law Abū Zikrī. For this purpose, Maḥrūz hired a private courier (najjāb) to Alexandria by camel. In his letter, Maḥrūz tells Abū Zikrī to disregard costs and extricate his wares without delay. The warning is repeated in a postscript written after Musallam (see the previous document) informed the writer that the courier would not set out that night. The Head of the Yeshiva's warning is not related to Abu Zikri's urgent request to him in II, 58, since that letter was written several years after II, 59. No. II, 59 is dated Sunday, 15 Jumada. Since Maḥrūz urges Abu Zikri to return to Fustat to be with his family before the approaching holiday, the date can be fixed with a fair degree of certainty as March 2, 1135, when 15 Jumada I came four weeks before Passover. (I do not know why Goitein assumed the letter had been written before 1129.) As already noted, Maḥrūz was not accustomed to writing, and others penned for him most of his letters, which have been preserved, except for this one and V, 20. Because ofthe urgency ofthis letter, he evidently wrote it himself. His untrained hand, poor style and substandard language, replete with vulgar forms and other orthographic irregularities, prove the wisdom of his normal practice.}"" Also of note: Maṣliaḥ Gaon is sick with ""the stone"" (al-ḥaṣā), i.e., a urinary stone (r17).

Dating: Adar I [1]467 Seleucid, which is January 25–February 23, 1156 CE. The letter gives a uniquely detailed report on a shipwreck, as the addressee's son-in-law Hiba b. Abū Saʿd was on board, and the addressee had requested verification of his death and details about the retrieval of his possessions. The sender devotes the entire letter to the former and adds only one brief sentence in the margin of verso, about the possessions, which were confiscated by the sultan. The ship belonged to the Nagid Ḥalfon b. Maḍmūn b. Ḥasan. Most of the cargo on the ship belonged to him, though every Jewish trader in Aden had some cargo on it. There were only four Jews on board. It was called the Kūlamī ship as it set out for Kūlam aka Kollam aka Quilon on the Malabar Coast. The court of Aden here presents all of the available evidence for the shipwreck: eyewitness accounts, secondhand reports, and legal pronouncements. The main source of the information that the ship sank came from the Barībatanī ship which sailed together with it, i.e., the ship for Valapattanam aka Valarapattanam aka Balyapattanam, a port five miles from Cannanore aka Kannur, which is north of Kollam. During the rest of that year and the following year, travelers arrived in Aden coming from all over India, from East Africa (""the land of the Zanj""), from Somalia (""the inland region of Berbera""), from Abyssinia and its provinces, and from the south Arabian regions of Ashḥār and Qamar, and the accounts of all travelers were consistent with the Kūlamī ship having been wrecked. The court in Aden had ruled that the evidence was sufficient to free Sitt al-Ahl, the daughter of Hillel b. Naḥman, from being an ʿaguna, but they defer to the authorities in Egypt, as this was a lenient and tenuous ruling. The sender of this letter, Saʿīd b. Marḥab, is incidentally the earliest known Yemeni Jewish poet. (Information from Goitein and Friedman, India Traders; see analysis and translation there for further details.)"

The writer's anonymous associate, whose account is registered here, was charged for the receipt of various commodities, including both Indian products and items usually imported for personal use from Yemen and the West. He must have been a Yemeni or from elsewhere in the West, who was staying in India. Commodities: civet, cinnabar, a copper pot, glass vessels, raisins, a lamp (or Indian horse chestnut? what is written is ""qandalī""), sugar, honey, myrrh, storax, and Egyptian sugar. One of the important pieces of information to emerge from this document (assuming the merchant was careful with his sums) is that the fanam was not precisely a quarter of a fīlī but rather slightly less: the ratio is 0.236 in this document.

Avraham but opens with salutations to 'the two esteemed brothers,' namely the addressee and his brother, here named ʿAli. Towards the end of the document greetings are sent to Abū ʿAlī. who is evidently the same individual. Abū ʿAlī Ibn al-Amshāṭī is known from sources discussed in pages 103–4, and with the assistance of this letter he can be identified as Abū l-Fakhr Saadya's brother Ḥananel.

The letter thus not only testifies to the Yijū family's dependence on the Ibn al-Amshāṭīs but also provides additional information on members of that illustrious family. The letter is almost certainly connected to III, 47. Moshe decided not to rely entirely on his brother Peraḥya to ask Abū l-Fakhr's advice on what to do with the lac that he wanted to sell in Alexandria, as implied in III, 47v, lines 1-3, and addressed that important merchant directly: (14) I have attached these few lines to you to inform you of my condition and what happened (15) to me on disembarking.

The writer cannot come to Fustat, and he asks the addressee to handle some business and money matters for him. The reason for this is that he has numerous illnesses (amrāḍ shattā), the least of which is the jarab (probably trachoma, but the word can also refer to skin diseases), and so he cannot sit or ride. Furthermore, factoring in travel expenses, he does not think the gains will outweigh the losses in his money and his health. But if the addressee thinks it is absolutely necessary, he will bear the 'fasting and difficulty' and make the trip. Meanwhile, a rumor spread in Fustat about Yehuda b. Moshe b.

5810,Letter,"illness letter 969-1517, heartsickness, fasting, 11th c, illness: du'f, personal, food, Illness, Salerno, Tripoli (Libya), Normans","Letter from the sister of Yeshuʿa b. Ismāʿīl al-Makhmūrī, in Tripoli, Libya, to her brother Yeshuʿa b. Ismāʿīl al-Makhmūrī. In the handwriting of ʿAllūsh the shammash. Dating: ca. 1065. While Yeshuʿa is dealing with the import and export of goods, his sister asks for help because she is in a very bad situation. T-S 10J19.20 is another version of the same letter (differences are noted in curly brackets in this partial translation). ""I have been waiting all year for a letter from you to learn your news. The fuyūj came, and I did not see a letter. {This increased the preoccupation of my heart.} I went out to inquire about your news, and they told me you were ill (ḍaʿīf). I went out of my mind. {I fasted and wept and did not change my clothing or enter the bath, neither I nor your sister.} I vowed not to eat during the day, not to change my clothing, and not to enter the bath, neither I nor my daughter, until your letter arrived with your news. The ships arrived, and I went down, with my hand on my heart, to hear your news. The men came down and told us that you were well. I thanked God who made the end good."" Goitein, and later Krakowski, used this letter to illustrate the intense affective bonds between brother and sister, as well as the notion of fasting as an intercession for a loved one who is sick (Goitein, Med Soc V, p. 97). Yet it is also the case that their relationship has lapsed—the brother has not contacted the sister in a year, not even sending greetings in his letter to Tammām (""my heart was wounded by this""). In the meantime, she has fallen into terrible financial difficulties. Her vows of self-negation and insistent repetition of ""I have nobody except God and you"" are also a demonstration of how much the sister has suffered from the brother's behavior, how much she thinks about him despite his neglect, and an attempt to elicit a response from him at last. Regarding the specifics of her financial difficulties, see Krakowski, Coming of Age, p. 150, where the relevant passage is translated: ""My brother, I have become embroiled in a quagmire from which I do not think we can be freed—I and a young orphan girl (i.e., her daughter). What occurred was that my son-in-law (i.e., the girl’s fiancé) wintered in Salerno and returned only with the Egyptian ships; then he said to me, “I will take the girl.” I said to him, “What are you thinking? As I was this year, I have nothing.” Then people advised me that I should borrow and incur debt (i.e., for a lavish dowry) and give her to him, because the Rūm (i.e., Normans) have burnt the world. Now . . . if free persons could be sold for dirhams, I would be the first to be sold, for I cannot describe my predicament to you . . . (I swear) by these lines that when Passover came I had not even a farthing’s worth of chard, nor even a dirham; instead I cut a nettle from the ruins and cooked it. . . . My brother, help me with some portion of this debt engulfing me—do not abandon me and do not forsake me."" Yeshuʿa b. Ismāʿīl al-Makhmūrī, incidentally, was prone to illness: see also T-S 16.163 and T-S Misc.25.124 (as noted by Krakowski), and T-S 12.389 and BL OR 5542.20.

The writer describes the terrible famine in Egypt, which even leads to cases of eating people. The writer also describes the epidemic in the area. Despite all that, business continues. He writes about pepper, flax, and oil. (Information from Gil, Kingdom, Vol. 3, #495) VMR. The part about the epidemic begins in line 14 of recto. ""There is a great epidemic (wabā') in the cities of the coast. As for Qayrawān, no one remains there [alive? or who has not fled?]—may God preserve you in health. Do not go roaming about the villages, for these are difficult times. [Or, if you read mā instead of lā, ""Difficult times have recurred in the villages.""] By God, by God, be vigilant for yourself. 'Who is called wise? He who sees the consequences' [Tamid 32a]. Be vigilant in all things before you enter into them."" The next sentence is difficult; Gil marks his translation as doubtful and suggests that Ismāʿīl is exhorting his son to be careful about whom he puts his trust in. But perhaps it reads instead, ""wa-lā taṭam'an man yabqa li-yabqa wa-lā lī hūwa waqt yūjibuhu bihi lā ḥīla,"" meaning ""do not trust in [the belief that] 'he who [is destined to] survive, will survive,' for in my view this time does not call for a 'nothing can be done.'"" This would be an unusual use of ""lā ḥīla,"" since usually the writer means to say, ""nothing can be done [except trust in God]."" But it would fit the preceding exhortation to be exceedingly vigilant and to consider the consequences of his actions instead of simply trusting in God. ASE. On verso in line 2, he mentions the arrival of some letters ḍabāratan, in a bundle or a file, possibly one pierced and loosely bound with string (on which see this short lecture by Marina Rustow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1nMtoEDbmc)."

5817,Letter,,"Letter from Ismāʿīl b. Faraḥ, in Alexandria, to his son Faraḥ b. Ismāʿīl, in Būṣīr. In Judaeo-Arabic. Dating: Gil suggests 23 September 1056 CE. This is because the letter was written on 12 Tishrei, likely the same day that Ismāʿīl b. Faraḥ wrote T-S 10J15.4 to Nahray b. Nissim. Gil dates T-S 10J15.4 on the basis of its similarity to BL OR 5542.9, which was written when Monday fell on the 27th of Elul, which apparently happened in 1053 CE and 1056 CE, and of the two he believes 1056 CE to be a better fit. The letter possibly contains information about Nahray’s eye disease, a report that Ismāʿīl will soon travel to the villages to buy linen, and the news about the bad events that are happening in Sicily. (Information from Gil, Kingdom, Vol. 3, #491) VMR. Nahray is known from other letters to have suffered from ophthalmia, but it is not clear that his eye disease figures in this letter. Gil reads, ""bi-mā tabaqqarat lahu ʿaynuhu, wa-innahu ʿalā ʿayn mā tarāhu"" (r5–6), and translates, ""that his eye split open and he stands to lose his vision in one eye."" However, when the phrase עלי עין מא תראה appears in other Geniza letters it seems to refers to a temporary not seeing or not being seen, e.g. ""do not buy anything if eye-does-not-see"" (T-S 13J26.22) or ""if my son turns out to be a worthless employee, get rid of him ('make him eye-does-not-see')"" (T-S 24.78). The second clause in the sentence in this letter could also be wa-anta ʿalā ʿayn mā tarāhu, meaning '[you received word from Nahray about X] without having seen him.' The first clause is difficult to read; the form ""tabaqqara"" does not appear in Arabic dictionaries, and it is possible that the word ʿaynahu is actually ʿaybahu. In sum, both the reading and the meaning of the sentence are obscure, but it is likely that there is no information here about Nahray's eye disease. Corroborating evidence for the absence of illness is that Ismāʿīl wrote to Nahray on the same day (T-S 10J15.4) and two days later (T-S 8.66) and did not send good wishes for a recovery. ASE."

It is remarkable (as Goitein notes) that the paper still retained this designation three centuries later. Ṣāliḥ asks for some of this paper in order to use it to write ""to Baghdad and Ereṣ Yisraʾel,"" by which presumably he means the yeshivot or the communal leaders.

5926,Letter,"flax, tax, silk, lead, oil, indigo, bribe, leather, wet bale","Letter from Ḥayyim b. ʿAmmār al-Madinī, from Palermo, probably to Yosef b. Musa al-Tahirti (according to Gil, but the name of the recipient is lost). Dating: around 1055 (also Gil). The letter contains details about damage to goods (flax and indigo) that were sent from Egypt to Sicily. In addition, mentions details about silk, leather, oil, and lead being exported from Sicily. Jessica Goldberg opens her book Trade and Institutions in the Medieval Mediterranean with a beautiful and gripping unravelling of the contents of this letter: 

""Around the year 1050 a bale sat on the shore at the port of Mazara in western Sicily. It was wrapped in canvas and tied with rope, and on the outside was written the name “Maṣliaḥ b. Eli[yy]ah[u],” the dayyan (judge) of Palermo. It contained indigo, and a bale of it represented a great deal of money: around 175 dinars if it was the Syrian variety, triple that if it was good Kirmānī. But the bale was wet, a fact that would both reduce the value of the indigo and mean a lot of work for someone. So it sat on the shore for several days.

""Ḥayyim b. ‘Ammār, the Palermo “representative of the merchants” (wakīl al-tujjār), was also down on the Mazara shore, sorting, spreading, airing, and re-packing the indigo in a second wet bale dropped off by the same unweatherly ship. Aḥmad b. Dā’ūd, a clerk whom all the people of Palermo had agreed to leave in charge of their goods, asked him about the orphaned bale. Ḥayyim suggested moving it to the funduq until they heard from Maṣliaḥ. But Maṣliaḥ, writing from Palermo, said the bale did not belong to him at all, and he refused to receive it. On the other hand, could Ḥayyim get the two sections of indigo belonging to his brother out of the bale and send them to him? Ḥayyim presented this plan to Aḥmad b. Dā’ūd, who was equally quick to reject responsibility: “If you are willing to accept the bale in its entirety, fine. If you don’t want to, I’m not going to open it for you to take what you like and leave the rest with me.” Ḥayyim wrote to the judge again, who repeated his request that Ḥayyim handle matters and fetch him the requested sections. So Ḥayyim, whose professional duty as wakīl meant he “sought to arrange everything for the best” for everyone, went to Aḥmad and said he would pay for everything and take it to his own warehouse, provided Aḥmad would open it and record all the details of each bundle – its weight and label. Aḥmad stood on the balcony of the funduq while the bale was opened and took down everything in his ledger. There were seven sections of indigo: three were labeled as belonging to Mūsā b. Abī ’l-Ḥayy and were to be delivered to Maṣliaḥ b. Eliah; two were labeled for delivery to Maṣliaḥ's brother; and two were labeled for delivery to Ismaʿīl b. Hārūn. One of the last sections contained some pumpkin seeds and rice along with the indigo. One of the merchants on hand to witness the unpacking, Maymūn, said that the section with the pumpkin seeds belonged to Abū Isḥāq, who had had it packed in Cairo itself. 

""As everyone had suspected this bale caused no end of trouble for Ḥayyim. After it was opened he got a letter from Abū Isḥāq telling him of a change of intent: he was to deliver the sections labeled to Isma‘īl b. Hārūn to Nissīm b. Shemariah instead. In the dispute that followed when both arrived from Palermo and Ḥayyim refused to give Isma‘īl the package, Isma‘īl and his brother denounced Ḥayyim to the “inspectors,” saying that he was undermining Muslim institutions by evading customs duties. Insults and accusations were traded among the merchants when they were hauled in front of the Muslim authorities (al-sulṭān). Worst of all, and shameful, Ḥayyim's brothers-in-law were among those who witnessed the abuse hurled at him; in return, in a moment of anger he insulted one of the other men on the quality of both his wife and his in-laws. The case, and the payments involved, were apparently not settled to Ḥayyim's satisfaction, for he detailed the entire episode in a letter to an associate in Fustat (whence the bale had originated), asking that he take the letter and read it to his (the associate’s) brother-in-law. No doubt the arguments would continue in Fustat and Alexandria, where most of the owners made their homes.""

Dating: Probably beginning of the 11th century. Yaʿaqov reports that he arrived safely in Baghdad on the 15th of Tammuz. He looked for Mājid but was told that he had already come and gone before Shavuot, and he looked for Abū l-Riḍā b. al-Ṣadr al-Tājir al-Baghdādī but was told that he had traveled to Hamadān. Yaʿaqov is optimistic that these men will return with the ḥajj caravans. As for the two yeshivot, Yaʿaqov declined to join either one of them so as not to offend the other. He told them that he had made a vow to visit the graves of holy men (Gil suggests specifically the grave of Ezekiel). He then traveled to Shamṭuniyya, where he found everyone sick from an epidemic disease. The writer himself became ill with a swelling, probably an abscess, on his leg, from which he developed a fever and was bedbound for 17 days. His son Abū l-Barakāt then became ill with a very high constant fever (""like a blazing fire""). Yaʿaqov sent to Baghdad for materia medica and mixed the medicinal syrup (sharāb) for his son himself, which he gave him each day together with barley water (mā' al-shaʿīrūn). His son is now feeling better. At first they were staying in the house of Abū Saʿd 'the paqid' b.

Dating: possibly early 13th century. The writer was ill for 40 days, recovered, then relapsed. The writer is extremely distraught and apologetic about not being able to fulfill Eliyyahu's request to send some of the <em>kawlān</em> (papyrus?)—or perhaps its proceeds—that he had previously left with the writer. This is because Musa, the son of the sister of 'sayyidnā', arrived and demanded his uncle's share and took the larger package. Then the writer managed to sell some of the smaller package for 2 dirhams per ounce, which he thought was a good price, but Eliyyahu has told him that he should have gotten 10 dirhams per ounce. He hasn't even collected the full price from the buyer, and there is an ongoing court case. The handwriting resembles that of Yehuda b. Aharon b. al-ʿAmmānī.

Dating: 11th or 12th century; likely 11th. Opens with allusions to various disputes or rumors thereof. Someone told the sender that the addressee was mad at her and would not send her letters, so she wept and argued that this can't be the case. She swears by Abū l-Ḥasan (likely their father). She tells the addressee he has saddened her heart and urges him to write, because she has no one but God and him. She says that ""my tears are on my cheek"" night and day and she has taken an oath not to eat fatty foods (zafar) until she sees a letter from him, in his own hand. She was happy to hear of the successful childbirth (khalāṣ) of Umm Abū l-Ḥasan (likely the addressee's wife) and sends blessings. She alludes to suffering at the hands of Ibn Ḥātim. There follow more allusions to arguments and rumors of arguments. She refers to the talk of a wife (zawja) or wedding (zīja) and blames the servant (ghulām) of the elder Yaʿaqov, who writes to him (probably Ibn Ḥātim) claiming that the addressee insults him and calls him 'al-fāʿil al-ṣāniʿ' (cf. ENA 4010.7 + ENA NS 19.14 (PGPID 6784) and T-S AS 169.292 + T-S AS 169.291 + T-S AS 169.294 + T-S NS 220.29 (PGPID 36211)).

The addressee should send a letter thanking him for his good treatment. Marwān is always with her and serves her well. He went to retrieve the oil, because it is in danger from the earthquakes. It is not impossible that the sender is a man, but all of the tropes here are more typical of women's letters (e.g., ""I have no one but God and you,"" weeping and fasting until a letter from the addressee arrives, being treated well by a man who will decide where they will live).

In the name of the Merciful, Compassionate. 
O assembly of Muslims, and Fugitives, and Helpers. O people of the Prophet (peace upon him), O bearers of the Qurʾān, O people of the Prophet (peace upon him), of fasters of the month of Ramaḍān, I am a man who has detached himself from the sons of Ḥunayy b. Akhṭab b. Hanina of Khaybar, whom we came and overpowered, [to whom] our foot made war, and [whom] our horses carried away. We freely gave up our persons and provisions six days in the lustrous week. Then out came to us our mother, viz. the mother of al-Ḥunayy b. Akhṭab, saying: ""Sabbath has come and the time of prayer."" We answered her: ""We have neither Sabbath, nor feast, nor rest, nor sleep, until the Prophet of Allah (may Allah pray for him and greet him) fulfill that which Allah has inspired him with."" The Prophet of Allah (may, &c.) accepted this, and our Sabbath was not incumbent upon us. He married Safiyya, the daughter of our uncle, and gave her her freedom and marriage gift. And he wrote for us a treaty and covenant. . .  ʿAlī b. Abū Ṭālib (may, &c.), that he should take the letter out, kiss it, draw it over his face, and read it [as follows]:

In the name of the Merciful, Compassionate. 
This is a letter from Muḥammad, the Messenger of Allah to Ḥanina and the people of Khaybar and Maqnā and their progeny as long as the heavens are above the earth, peace. I praise unto you God, save whom there is no God but he. Now [I say that] he has revealed unto me that you are about to return to your cities and to the inhabitants of your dwelling-place. Return in safety, in the protection of Allah and that of his Messenger. Yours is the safeguard of Allah and that of his Messenger with regard to your persons, belief, and property, slaves, and whatever is in your possession. You shall not have the annoyance of land-tax, nor shall a forelock of yours be cut off. No army shall tread on your soil, nor shall you be assembled [for military service], nor shall tithes be imposed on you, neither shall you be injured in any way. No one shall leave his mark on you, you shall not be prevented from wearing slashed or coloured garments, nor from riding horseback, nor from carrying any kind of arms. If any one attacks you, fight him, and if he is killed in the war against you, none of you shall be executed for his sake, nor is ransom to be paid for him. If one of you kills a Muslim intentionally, he shall be dealt with according to Muslim law. No disgraceful charges shall be brought against you, and you shall not be as other [non-Muslim] poll-tax payers. If you ask assistance, it shall be granted to you, and if you want help you shall have it. You shall not be punished for white, nor yellow, nor brown (garments), nor for a coat of mail, nor .... Not a shoe-lace of yours shall be cut. You shall not be hindered entering the mosques, nor precluded from governing Muslim. You shall have no other ruler except out of your own midst, or from the family of the messenger of Allah. Room shall be made for your funerals, except when they trespass on a sacred spot (mosque). You shall be held in honour on account of your own high station and the station of Ṣafiyya, the daughter of your Uncle. It shall be incumbent upon the people of the house of the Messenger of Allah and upon the Muslims to uphold your honour, and not to touch you (?). If any of you goes on a journey, he shall be under the safeguard of Allah and his Messenger. ""There is no compulsion in matters of religion."" If any of you follows the religion of the Messenger of Allah and his command, he shall have one fourth of what the Messenger of Allah has ordered to be given to the people of his house, to be given when the Quraysh receive their portions, viz. fifty dinars. This is a present from me for you. The family of the house of the Messenger of Allah as well as the Muslims are charged to fulfill all that is in this letter. Whoever deserves well of Ḥanina and the people of Khaybar and Maqnā, all the better for him; but he who does them evil, all the worse for him. Whoever reads this my letter, or to whomever it is read, and he alters or changes anything of what is in it, upon him shall be the curse of Allah and the curse of the cursing of. . . and all mankind. He is beyond my protection and intercession on the day of Resurrection, and I am his foe. And who is my foe is the foe of Allah, and he who is the foe of Allah goes to hell. . . and bad is the abode there. Witness is Allah, like whom there is no God, and Allah is sufficient as witness, and his angels. . ., and those Muslims who are present. ʿAlī, the son of Abū Ṭālib, wrote it with his writing, whilst the Messenger of Allah dictated to him letter for letter, Friday, the 3rd of Ramaḍān, in the year five of the Hijra.

Yoshiyyahu, in Fustat. In Judaeo-Arabic with some Hebrew. Calligraphically written with wide space between the lines. Dating: 1108–09 CE.

Saʿadya to have the Fatimid navy rescue Evyatar and his family from Tripoli in the period between the summer of 1108 CE (when the populace of Tripoli overthrew Ibn ʿAmmār) and 12 July 1109 CE, when the Franks sacked Tripoli. Goes on to refer to the flight of Fakhr al-Mulk Ibn ʿAmmār from Tripoli and how he left it in the hands of his cousin Abū l-Manāqib. The sender says that he has previously sent a letter concerning ""the same matter"" to ""our cousin,"" a great dignitary and a kohen. ""They took it and traveled with it... toward the beginning of Shabbat Vayoshaʿ (=Beshalaḥ?), the day that Ibn ʿAmmār traveled for Beirut—let him return no more to his house, and let not his place know him any more (Job 7:10)—and then traveled for Tiberias (? טברי) to fortify himself there, and the city is now in the hand of his cousin (ibn ʿamm) Abū l-Manāqib."" In the bottom section (note that there is still a gap between T-S AS 153.177 and T-S 18J5.3), refers to ""in this crisis and others...""; the sender says that he has already explained the condition of the 'brother' Abū l-Faḍl and his family in other letters; he reiterates greetings to the addressee and his two sons; and his own two sons, ʿAzaryahu and Maṣliaḥ, convey their greetings. Ends with a motto that might be reconstructible as [yu]ḥash [yeshaʿ] be-qarov (יוחש ישע בקרוב).

It is not clear that the recipient's wife features in this letter at all. Goitein read ""ahl al-makān"" in line 14 as referring to the recipient's wife, but this could just as well be referring to the writer's conflict with his own wife, which he wishes the recipient to mediate.

Sold by a woman, probably a widow, whose son owned the adjacent property with two shops. This is not the original deed but rather a Judaeo-Arabic digest or summary of an Arabic-script (Muslim court) deed, headed ""the boundaries of the House on the Jazīra."" (See Moss. VII,51.1 (PGPID 16085) for a similar case.) There are also Arabic-script section headers for each boundary (al-ḥadd al-awwal... al-ḥadd al-thānī wa-huwa al-baḥrī... etc.). Goitein noticed one corroborating piece of evidence that this was copied from an Arabic-script legal document, namely that the scribe transcribed the nonsensical ""twmyd"" (תומיד) for the original ""yawmaʾidhin"" (ىومىد). See NLI 577.2/8 (PGPID 38534) for another instance of the same type of error. (The scribe probably a made a similar error with ריס אלפלאפטה; the word was likely 'qalāfiṭa' in the original document, meaning 'caulkers.') The Jazīra, which Goitein describes as the domicile of high society, was government property, and therefore the buyer of the house had to pay a monthly tax (ground rent / ḥikr) of 5/8 dirhams and the land was not included in the sale.  Sales of houses were frequently made before both Muslim and Jewish notaries or courts. The seller of the house was a woman, probably a widow, and an adjacent property belonged to her son. The house described here bordered on one which had once belonged to the Fatimid vizier Yaʿqūb Ibn Killis (d. 991) and other people of high standing. Goitein's notes mention an entry in a court notebook from 1136 CE involving another house on the Jazīra worth at least 660 dinars and owned by a Jew: Bodl. MS Heb. e 98/63 (PGPID 6502). (Claire Schmeller and Marina Rustow based on Goitein's notes.) 

Verso: The boxed section in the lower left corner is a similar document, a summary of the four boundaries of [a property on Darb] al-Surriyya (about this street see T-S K25.254, T-S J1.47, and Gil, Documents, p. 307 note 7.)

In Judaeo-Arabic. Simḥa describes in moving terms the illness and death of his female slave (jāriya). Goitein and Motzkin understood this to refer to his daughter, however it probably means slave here, because Simḥa cites as condolence the formula from Berakhot 16b, ""המ ימלא חצרונכם"" (noted by Eve Krakowski, 07/2022). The physician Abū l-Thanāʾ had been caring for her in his home, and ultimately told Simḥa to take her back when her illness became hopeless. Simḥa (briefly) rejoiced because no one had expected her to walk again. A porter carried her home in a basket. She then died at home despite their hopes for her recovery.

Abū l-Majd complains of the difficult times and his illness, and the problems of selling a sick female slave who actively resists being sold (recto, margin).

Goitein's introduction: ""The Islamic dar wakala, or warehouse, like the Roman basilica, was a hall where goods were traded and stored and where judges and notaries had their seats for the settlement of disputes and arrangement of formalities connected with business transactions (see Med. Soc., i, 187-189, and here, introduction, sec. 3, above). Even a small town like Qalyub (northwest of Cairo) possessed such a semipublic building. Palm branches are frequently mentioned in building operations, and in our letter this type rather than the one used for religious purposes is intended. It is interesting that the permission of the chief of the police was required, probably because payment of a tax was involved. The letter is written in beautiful, clear Arabic characters, in many cases even equipped with diacritical marks. ... The verso contains also the beginning of the draft of a petition in Arabic language and Hebrew characters of the dyers in Qalyub. The words are crossed out, probably because the clerk realized that the sheet would not be sufficient for the text dictated to him. On the same page there is also a calligraphic trial of the pen: ""Said the Khazari."" ""Said the scholar."" This shows that in this little town there was a scribe who tried to copy the theological magnum opus of the Spanish Hebrew poet Judah ha-Levi. Learned scribes were often found in small towns, where life was less expensive than in the big cities. See Med. Soc., 11, 239.)"

Concerning the capitation tax of the bearer of the letter, who is (or was) the muqaddam of Damīra (his name may be given in line 6: النارين؟ الغاريب؟). The sender insists that this muqaddam is deserving and that they must help him. Interestingly he calls him a בעל תורה but writes it in Arabic characters: باعل تورا. In recent years, this person had paid his capitation tax in al-Maḥalla. It seems that this year he is registered as a newcomer in Fustat (and therefore exempt), but the authorities in al-Maḥalla refuse to recognize his documents. The recipient is to go to Abū l-Majd Thiqa, who is to get a certificate from the authorities in Fustat proving that he is exempt. If Abū l-Majd is unable to help, the recipient is to go to Abū l-Faraj b. al-Kohen. If it weren't for all the sender's work in the Rif, he would have come along himself to help this person. In the margin, he reminds the recipient of the books that he is supposed to send. Regards from the sender's nephew Abu Sahl. Regards to: the addressee's son Abū Naṣr; Abū l-Maʿālī and his children; Abū Isḥāq; Abū Saʿīd and his son. Goitein read the name of the sender as Abū l-Khayr and connects him to the Abū l-Khayr b.

8289,Letter,"illness letter 969-1517, aodeh, illness: emotion, Illness, hujja, qirad","Business letter in Arabic script from Abū l-Surūr b. Abū l-Munā (a Jewish man, which we learn in v5) to Abū l-Majd b. Abū l-Munā al-Dumyāṭī, in Asyūṭ. Abū l-Surūr defends himself against a charge of neglecting the addressee's affairs. He reports that as soon as the addressee departed, Khalīl became sick with a wound/ulcer (qarḥ). Khalīl paid Abū l-Surūr 68 dirhams in four installments for the shop, and continued to go to work even though he dozed all day long, and ultimately became homebound and died on the 2nd of Ramaḍān. Abū l-Surūr was unable to obtain any of the money which the deceased owed to the addressee. Ten days later, Abū Bakr al-Qasṭallānī produced a ḥujja that the deceased had owed him 700 dirhams from a qirāḍ partnership, and Abū Muḥammad b. Maḥfūẓ produced one that the deceased owed him a (non-partnership?) debt of 200 dirhams. They went to court, and the qāḍī ruled that only the holder of the ḥujja for the partnership (sharika), i.e., Abū Bakr al-Qasṭallānī, could collect his money. The shop was sold for 150 dirhams, but even so Abū Bakr only recovered half of the money due to him. (There are two asides at this point: During the time when Khalīl was sick and homebound, the clothier came to the sender, who paid him 20 dirhams. Also, the owner of the shawl (miṭrafa) which had been pawned with the addressee for 3 dirhams came and redeemed it.) Abū l-Surūr now rebukes the addressee for not having listened to him and staying with his shop. If he had followed this advice, he wouldn't have lost so much money and brought upon himself all this toil and trouble. Abū l-Surūr emphasizes that he spared no efforts in attempting to sue Khalīl for the money owed to the addressee, even when Khalīl was sick. One day, Khalīl's mother came and saw that he was distressed, and he said, ""Abu l-Surūr the Jew sued me for his friend's money and said 'hand over the goods,' which wounded my soul."" Whereupon the mother came to Abū l-Surūr and ""held on to [his] collar (aṭwāq)"" and accused him of killing her son. Abū l-Surūr says, ""my soul would have left me were it not for the neighbors and Khalīl (restraining?) her."" The same story repeated itself when Abū Bakr al-Qasṭallānī came and sued Khalīl. The letter concludes on a note of all's well that end's well: ""If you come back, God willing, you can have a shop for 50 (dirhams) and you will do well and recoup (your losses)."""

8339,List or table,demographics,"Three lists of contributors, the first for the lighting (in the synagogue) with wax candles. Mostly in Arabic script. See Goitein's note cards and Med Soc II, 492–93, appendix C, #55. See also Elisha Russ-Fishbane, ""Earthquake, Famine, and Plague in Early Thirteenth-Century Egypt: Muslim and Jewish Sources,"" p. 158. 

Russ-Fishbane:
'The second document, dating to 1235, concerns a charitable appeal to the community of Fustat for an emergency sum of 300–500 dirhems. A note to a draft of the appeal questioned the attainability of this goal: “But how can this be achieved, seeing that the number of adult males in Fustat today does not even reach 200?” Based on the estimates of average family size suggested by Goitein for the twelfth century, this would bring the total population of the city to somewhere around 600 individuals. Compared with the estimated population figures for the 1160s, this would indicate a reduction of sixty to eighty per cent of the original population. These figures alone speak volumes of the state of the city’s decline and its inability to immediately recover from the severe blows of the early years of the century.'

Goitein:
'Emergency appeal for the purchase of wax candles both for the synagogue and needy persons (see B 89, 90) and also for some other communal expenses. Written mostly in Arabic characters and with Coptic numerals. Each household is listed with the number of adult male persons (sometimes three generations) and the amount they are expected to contribute. Some brothers, or fathers and sons, appear as one household, others as separate contributors, but following each other In a factory each person is charged with 3 dirhems—the highest contribution—and the machinery, called dūlāb, literally, ""the wheel,"" with 7 dirhems. A tavern, qāʿat al-sharāb, pays dirhems (in the second instance, the sum is torn away. 

Difficulties were expected since by that time (1235–36) the community of Fustat had been reduced to ""less than 200 [male adult] persons The list is headed by ""Our Master Abraham and his boy"" (the Nagid Avraham Maimonides and his son David), then came ""Our Master Shelomo and his boy (the nasi Shelomo b. Yishay and his son Abū Naṣr Shemuel, the latter mentioned, e.g., in TS 20.175), and then ""Our Master Shemuel and his boy, probably the French rav, who was Jewish chief justice in Alexandria before moving to Cairo (see T-S 10J19.14, l. 15). Each of the three pays 2 dirhems, or 1 for each adult male, like all other persons except those engaged in specifically lucrative occupations.

The list, although only a partial one, is the most comprehensive found thus far in the Geniza with regard to this period. Page 1, incompletely preserved, states the purpose of the appeal and the goal (""over 300 dirhems"" or ""over 350 dirhems"") to be reached. Columns 2-11 contain the actual pledges (with a few exceptions all in Arabic characters) totaling 291 dirhems. Columns 12-14 list the names of the persons who paid (mostly written in large neat Hebrew characters). Column 15 notes the expenditure made from these sums in particular payments to the banker Munajjā: 30, 20, 15 dirhems and other smaller sums, as well as some minor items, such as wax, 20, olive oil, 1 1/2, police officials, 2 + 2. Columns 16-17 enumerate thirty-two persons who received wax candles, among them three makers of pastry, three dyers, a fishmonger or fisherman, two from al-Maḥalla, and others, all evidently people in need of help.

The list of pledges names about 65 households, comprising about 135 adult male persons; some 15 names, referring presumably to 30 or so persons are lost. The total of about 165 male adults comes rather close to the ""less than 200 persons"" referred to above. The balance were paupers who were beneficiaries of, rather than contributors to, the collection. But a few of the 32 receivers of wax candles appear also among the contributors.

8708,Letter,tax farming,"Petition requesting that the addressee intervene on behalf of the writer, whose trees have been sold by an abusive ḍāmin named Karīm without permission. It appears that Karīm had subleased a tax-farm to the petitioner, and, under circumstances not specified, then sold the petitioner's trees (or the right to the tax income they produced?). The petitioner asks the addressee to order Karīm to pay him what he has collected and may still collect from this tax-farm. (That petitioner doesn't include a request about giving back his trees suggests that they weren't his to begin with — so the most likely scenario seems to be that the trees were on the property for which the petitioner had the tax-farm.)"

The petition is written in a crude hand, perhaps by the woman herself. (Information from CUDL.) Translated in Goitein, Mediterranean Society, V, 201: ""I[n Your name, o Merciful]. I hereby inform your Excellency, our Gaon—may his Rock preserve him—that I am a lonely orphan girl whom they have married to a man with no means of support. I have been with him for ten years, and he has always taken what I earned. Finally, when I was in shreds, with nothing to cover me properly, I said to him: ""I shall not give you a thing anymore. I'll buy myself clothing with what I earn."" He is not worth a thing, not even one dinar. For a year or more he has given me a bad name. I went to the judges and offered to buy myself free with everything due me from him to save my honor. But they did not grant me a divorce. By God, my honor is worth something to me! I am requesting now that the Torah scroll be taken out and that he who acted in this way and tells lies about me be excommunicated, and that I be given a certificate clearing [my honor] for God's sake.

8909,Letter,"India, IB5","Letter from Abū Zikrī Kohen in Fustat, to Abū Zikrī Yaḥyā b. Sulaymān b. al-Shāmī, in ʿAydhāb. In Judaeo-Arabic. Dated: Ṭevet 1452 Seleucid = December 1140 / January 1141 CE. Deals with business matters, mentioning commodities such as camphor, brazilwood, and frankincense. 

Goitein's handwritten description in his notes:
""The letter is directed to the East African port ʿAidhāb, for the writer like asks the receiver to take action there, cf. top, l.1–verso, l.7. It was sent from Cairo, for the sender reports that people were going up to ʿAidāb top, ll. 6–8, and he includes a list of prices with the request to buy at the receiver's place. No. 244 is instructive in various respects. It shows us the motivation of the representative of the merchants of Cairo as that of ʿAidhāb. The way in which Abū Zikrī asks the receiver to look after the novice Mufaḍḍạl, verso ll.7–14, is tantamount to an outright command and the same could be said about his order to deal with the goods saved from the Dībājī's ship, margin l.6–verso l.7. Likewise we find the Wakīl of ʿAidhab in charge of the goods saved from Dībājī's boat, although another man, Akbar, had received them. To be sure, the merchants concerned, both Muslims and Jews, had entrusted the Wakīl with this task. On the other hand, it is astonishing that the Muslim merchants and one Jew, Nahrai, had to make the long and dangerous journey from Cairo to ʿAidhāb in order to take over their goods. [[Most probably great quantities were involved.]] In no. [reference to be inserted later] we find Nahrai setting out from ʿAidhāb in the Dībājī's boat. Here, it is to be understood that he had come back in the same. If the goods saved were pepper, lac and brazilwood it is safe to assume that the ship did not founder, in which case these products were likely to be spoiled, but was captured by pirates and later on recaptured, most probably by the Fatimid fleet. It is interesting to learn from our letter, l.19–margin l.1, that a merchant could take a credit from the Dīwān, government, in ʿAidhāb. It cannot be assumed that for this he needed the recommendation of representatives of the merchants, as Abū Zikrī would have certainly referred to a relevant document attached. The reason for this extraordinary precaution obviously was the following: the Oriental goods were sent ""en bloc"", with the share, qisṭ, of each merchant indicated in the list handed over to the Wakīl. A considerable part of the sending was lost, margin l. 7. The merchants obviously did not trust the Wakīl to portion off the remainder equitably. About this important aspect of the Wakīl's office, see [reference to be inserted later]."""

Natanʾel in al-Ghuwwa, Yemen, ca. summer 1131, concerning the controversy over the reshut of Maṣliaḥ gaʾon over the Jews of Yemen and the collection on behalf of the yeshiva in Fustat. Yaʿaqov b. Salīm, leader of a Jewish community in Yemen, having left Aden and moved to al-Ghuwwa, sends Ḥalfon a secret letter for Maṣliaḥ, head of the Jews in Egypt, and another letter for Abū Zikrī ha-Kohen, representative of the merchants in Fustat. Yaʿaqov b. Salīm had managed to get the Jews in the villages of Yemen to send contributions for Maṣliaḥ, and he asks Ḥalfon to beware lest the letters fall into the hands of his enemies. In case Ḥalfon is delayed on his journey to Egypt, he should ask Abū l-Yumn to deliver the letters personally. Yaʿaqov hopes he will receive an answer from Maṣliaḥ within the year. He also comments on books that he has sent to Ḥalfon, and notes that he had already copied the letter sent to him from al-Ghuwwa while he was staying in Aden. Yaʿaqov b. Salīm had left Aden for al-Ghuwwa because, like others, he was seceding from the authority of Maḍmūn b. Yefet and didn't want to be involved in controversy, all the more so given what we learn from his letter regarding contributions collected for the yeshiva of Palestine in this period of controversy. He himself had sent 34 dinars as an annual contribution from the villages of Yemen. The letter seems not to know that the villages had refrained from contributing that year — a rumor based on the exilarch's preventing the congregation from saying the reshut clause in the name of Maṣliaḥ gaʾon. Yaʿaqov b. Salīm points out that only two villages had not yet contributed, and that when their contribution came, the total contribution of the villages would be 404 dinars, a good amount according to Yaʿaqov b. Salīm, but also a much larger sum that any other geniza document mentions as a contribution to any reshut. Goitein read the sum as 600 (תר) rather than 404 (תד), but after the number the word danān(īr) appears, which in both classical Arabic and in this letter comes only after units. The regular contribution in the name of the gaʾon of Palestine demonstrates the attachment of Yemeni Jews to the central institution of learning. This seems to be the earliest document written from Yemen in the controversy over the reshut. It is exceptional that Yaʿaqov b. Salīm warned Halfon to handle the letter with secrecy and destroy it; fortunately, Halfon didn't obey the warning. The letter is difficult to decipher, but includes specific information about the affair, such as the copying of letters from the Davidic Persians and details about the collection for Maṣliaḥ, as well as greetings to Halfon's children (""his lion cubs""). Yaʿaqov b. Salīm was already known from Mann, Jews in Egypt and in Palestine, 2:366 (doc. 65; read al-Ghuwwa instead of אלגיוהומא). (Information from Friedman and Goitein) IB ח5 (ד10)."

Yiṣḥaq supported Maṣliaḥ and was the only one willing to set the controversy down in writing; the other Jews of Aden were too afraid to do so. This document may be written in the hand of the North African trader Yosef Ibn ʿEzra, a partner of Ḥalfon. The Egyptian members of the congregation, by contrast, saw Maṣliaḥ as their authority.

This is a letter of gratitude for Ḥalfon's halakhic responsum on matrimonial matters concerning one Abū l-Ṭāhir, who needed to return to Aden from India. Ḥalfon had been asked to write his expert opinion with regard to a man who died without male offspring, in which case his widow was obliged to marry one of his brothers, normally the eldest (levirate marriage). It is reasonable to assume that R. Yaʿaqov, mentioned in l. 22 as someone who admired Ḥalfon's responsum, is Yaʿaqov b. Salīm, who wrote ח5 (CUL Or.1080 J225), who was close both to Ḥalfon and to Khalaf.

Abū Zikrī Kohen served as Ḥalfon’s representative and paid a debt to Khiyār for him. Also mentioned here are business affairs of Halfon, in which Abū Zikrī Kohen and Khiyār participated together. Other business affairs were between Halfon and Abū Zikrī Kohen alone. Several other personalities were mentioned, some of them known from other places, some of them unknown. The small sums of a few tens of dinars mentioned are probably leftovers from larger transactions. Ḥalfon intended to stay for a certain period in Qūṣ, because Abū Zikrī Kohen knew that he would be there when the letter and the few goods he sent there reached him. From there Ḥalfon intended to go to Aden, and Abū Zikrī Kohen ordered pearls from there for his little son.

But then merchants arrived in Egypt from Aden and reported that he was staying there. Previously Ḥalfon had deposited a quantity of pepper in Aden, which he had purchased for Abū Zikrī. He had already written to Maḥrūz b. Yaʿaqov concerning the prices of oriental goods in Egypt, and there was a similar list in the hands of the Egyptian merchant Abū Naṣr b. Avraham, who was then working in Aden. Abu Zikri urges Ḥalfon to buy goods in Aden and return to Egypt. However, if Ḥalfon wishes to return to India, Abu Zikri asks him to leave the pepper in the hands of Yosef b. Avraham, because this is already the third year that Abu Zikri cannot travel to Yemen. According to Abu Zikri, Ḥalfon's previous trip to India was unnecessary. Had he bought goods in Yemen and returned to Egypt in that year he would have made a good profit, for even the young and inexperienced merchants at that time in Egypt made immense profits from the goods they bought in Yemen. At the end of the letter, there are greetings to Ḥalfon from his family and the writer and a request to greet the important people of Aden and to help Abu Nasr b. Avraham.

The addressee is a dignitary referred to as 'rayyis,' and as Goitein surmised, it can be assumed that the recipient is Maḍmūn b. Ḥasan, the head of the Jews of Yemen and the representative of the merchants there. Some of the business was already arranged in Aden, 'in his seat' and in his presence. The writer reports that he stayed in India for a second year. He is sending a large shipment of fabrics to Aden with Barakāt b. Mūsā al-Ḥalabi.

The wording of the address is similar to those of other letters sent from Yemen to India, so plausibly this letter could have been sent to Ḥalfon during his time there.

Netanʾel in Bharuch, and the only account that survived in the Geniza that a merchant in Aden sent to a business partner in India. Dating: ca. 1134 CE. Sent together with IV,21 (now a new join by Amir Ashur: T-S AS 148.9 + T-S AS 148.197, PGPID 5466), which is a letter from Khalaf b. Yiṣḥaq to Ḥalfon b. Netanʾel. In this account, Khalaf summarizes an entire year of his commercial activities on behalf of Ḥalfon. Includes pepper (828 out of 1469 dinars) and textiles (578.21 dinars), plus a small amount of musk. The amount of 1469 dinars isn't the total amount of business that Khalaf conducted for Ḥalfon, since he didn't sell everything — the pepper, most likely because its price had dropped (r35). Khalaf doesn’t request payment for his services, because the stationary merchant, unlike the traveling merchant, traded for partners outside his home port not in exchange for compensation, but on the basis of reciprocity. Almost all the proceeds were invested immediately in new transactions that had to be done in India. In addition to coral, whose value reached nearly one third of the shipment's value, precious metals were used for this purpose: gold coins and silver (ingots or tools). He gives prices in the coin of Aden, the Malikī dinar, corresponding to 24 qīrāṭs, while textiles are traded in units of kawragha (pl. kawārigh), which is a bundle of twenty thawb (pl. athwāb; the word means not only cloak, but the unit of fabric of the size needed to make one). Also relates to the transactions discussed in a letter from Halfon to Maḍmūn b. Yefet, IV,18 (T-S 13J25.13, PGPID 9059). This cluster of documents also makes it possible to estimate how long Ḥalfon b. Netanʾel was in India. (Information from Goitein/Friedman, IB IV,22) MR"

Long letter in which Khalaf writes about an unfortunate turn in his business affairs. Khalaf had sent goods with Abū l-Yumn al-Maḥallī and Abū Zikrī al-Ṣā'igh to Egypt for Abū ʿImrān Ibn Nufayʿ and at that time had asked Ḥalfon to help Abū ʿImrān with the sales and purchases (r17–23). But Abū ʿImrān died, and Ḥalfon traveled to the West, and the two messengers suppressed Khalaf's letters and acted as if the merchandise belonged to them (r23–27). Abū l-Yumn was going to return to Aden, but he fell ill in Qūṣ and had to return to Fustat, and Khalaf does not know his current condition. Abū Zikrī al-Ṣā'igh is planning to travel on to the West. He had with him a container (mikḥala) of musk that was destined for Ḥalfon, but the head of the Jews, Maẓliāh Gaon, took the container from him before he traveled (r27–38). Khalaf has already asked Abū Zikrī Kohen, the representative of the merchants, to go to the courts with the purpose of recouping the value of the goods Khalaf has lost and sending the money back to Aden. In this letter, Khalaf asks Ḥalfon to assist Abū Zikri Kohen in this (r38–53). The letter continues with other business matters, including an update on the shipment of nard (sunbul) for Ḥalfon and his partner Mubārak al-Māliqī (i.e., from Malaga) that was detained in al-Qaṣṣ, evidently a location in NW India (r53–v3). Khalaf concludes with regards for Maṣliaḥ Gaon; for Ḥalfon's brother ʿEli Nezer ha-Maskilim; and for ""the congregations."" Khalaf is preoccupied that he has received no letters from Ḥalfon (v4–10).

If he violates the agreement, Yosef must pay twenty mithqāls 'to the poor of Almeria and the captives.' The deed was written by a professional scribe, but the addition on verso is by Ḥalfon himself. Just as document ח26 opens with the statement of the active partner, Yosef b. Shuʿayb Ibn al-Najera, who received money from Ḥalfon to trade in, so here Ḥalfon gave money to Yosef to trade in. If so, we have before us two partnership deeds that were written in the West between Ḥalfon, the investor, and a 'dealer' named Yosef, and it turns out that this refers to the same partner. Since it was agreed that if Yosef broke the agreement, he will give twenty mithqāls 'to the poor of Almeria and to the captives', this document was presumably written in Spain, at the time when Ibn Al-Najera visited Ḥalfon, in Lucena, at the beginning of July 1138.

In this letter, Ḥalfon apologizes for not having presented himself in person or having written earlier. He blames this on his wretched condition in the wake of his illnesses (v16–18) and the tribulations of his four-year journey to the Maghrib and to al-Andalus. In particular, he has been shaken by the deaths of his brother and the death of 'our diadem and crown and master and head' (v19–21); Goitein concludes that the references are to Ḥalfon's brother ʿEli and to the head of the Yeshiva, Maṣliah Gaon.

Although there is doubt as to which date is meant, the rest of the dates mentioned in the letter, with day of the week and month, correspond to 1139 CE.

9112,Letter,"India, IB4, nar","Letter from Yeḥezqel, probably in Qalyūb, to his brother Ḥalfon in Alexandria. Dated/dating: Iyar 1140. Yeḥezqel complains rather winningly and at great length about his various business problems: ""I'm oppressed, but being painted an oppressor"" (anā maẓlūm fī ṣūrat ẓālim), i.e., I’m being blamed for things that aren’t my fault. The problems in question: their cheese venture (see IB ח69, ח68, ח64) and the legal proceedings related to it, on which the judges were unable to reach a decision; goods delayed in the bayt al-wakīl, about which the judges wanted the parties to reach a compromise; and a legal action related to the sale of a house, with judges unable to reach a decision: should the decision be according to the approach of Hayye Gaʾon or Yiṣḥaq al-Fāsī? One of the judges suggests to Yeḥezqel that Ḥalfon should have solicited a responsum (fatwā) from Ibn Mīgash, which would have strengthened their hand. Also discusses trade in donkeys (sold without tack because otherwise the price would have been higher) and a long story about transporting silk from the village of Banhā in the delta together with a tax-farmer named Abū Saʿd (perhaps the same one who appears as a former tax-farmer 25 years later in T-S 13J2.24 = PGPID 1008). This Abū Saʿd the tax-farmer (ḍāmin) worked as a pair with a ḍāmin from Cairo, and so couldn't just show up in Banhā at the drop of a hat to help Yeḥezqel transport Abū Zikrī Kohen's silk back to Qalyūb (an eight-hour walk according to Google Maps). Moreover, two tax officials — a fellow tax-farmer in the dār al-ṣināʿa, the main customs point entering Fustat (see Med. Soc. .2:360, 606n34) and the tax-collector (mushidd, an Ayyubid term for the tax-collector at ports, on which Friedman cites Cahen, ’Le régime des impôts dans le Fayyūm ayyūbide,’ Arabica 3 [1956], 19), meaning the one working at the dār al-ṣināʿa? — ""don't let him take (even) one raṭl (of silk) as a fee (or bribe?), or it's said to him, 'That's not yours!' The injustice is rampant."" Unclear whether here we have the striking picture of a tax-farmer deeming it an injustice that his superiors forbid him from taking bribes; he uses the Hebrew word ḥamas, which in this period, according to Friedman, is a technical term for government-imposed injustice, so perhaps this is by comparison to some earlier period, when it was understood that tax-collectors could enrich themselves in kind. Mentions the death of Abū Naṣr b. al-Minqār, who was Ibn Yijū’s cousin, the son of his maternal aunt. Mentions the India trader Abū ʿAlī b. al-Kirnīb, who also appears in Maimonides' responsa. Although the names of the writer and addressee aren't stated explicitly because the letter has no address (it was probably hand-delivered), Goitein and Friedman identified them based on content and paleography.

He stayed in ʿAydhāb for a time before traveling further south (he wrote this letter after boarding the ship in ʿAydhāb). In the interim he already sent one letter to Ḥalfon and received one letter in response. The present letter asks Ḥalfon to help the bearer, a fellow man of Sijilmāsa, with some mercantile matters.

Yeḥezqel writes about the fear that gripped him when Ḥalfon left and boarded the boat, while ill and without any companion. The body of the letter deals with business matters, especially recounting disputes with others regarding debts. Yeḥezqel was helpled by Abū l-Waḥsh Sibāʿ. One of these disputes was with the 'youths' (ṣibyān) who owed money to Yeḥezqel. These youths recruited their Muslim neighbors against Yeḥezqel and threatened that their mother would appeal to the state authorities (al-sulṭān) to exempt them from repaying the debt until ('God forbid!' interjects Yeḥezqel) they recover from their illness. Yeḥezqel had already involved two trustees of the court and the Nagid himself, but the youths too appealed to the Nagid. Yeḥezqel continues with the matter of a certain aristocrat named Razīn al-Dawla, who is angry because he had given Yeḥezqel to purchase a garment for the winter, and the order had not been fulfilled. Yeḥezqel asks Ḥalfon to make haste in obtaining the garment, which should be in a beautiful yellow. It may be sent to Yeḥezqel in Qalyūb or to 'the Jew' (the tax farmer) in Shaṭnūf, which is the iqṭāʿ of Razīn al-Dawla.

She was treated for “the obstruction of the heart (inqifāl al-qalb) mentioned by al-Rāzī in the Manṣūrī,”  but the medicine only made matters worse.

Sibāʿ agrees to share equally in all losses to the partnership as a whole (e.g. losses due to work stoppage or broken merchandise). Lines 12-16 indicate that if commodities may end up traveling for sale in Alexandria escorted by someone other than the active partner, the active partner should inform Sibāʿ. The risk of loss is wholly carried by Sibāʿ. The active partner’s testimony concerning profits and losses does not require the support of witness testimony. The active partner seems to be entitled to all profits except for the maintenance of Sibāʿ(excluding Sibāʿ's rent and education costs for his son). Sibāʿ's share of the profits – a fixed amount unrelated to the success of partnership assets – might contravene the rabbinic prohibition of usury, but he does bear responsibility for losses. The use of the first person throughout the document suggests that it was prepared and notarized for the active partner, as with powers of attorney. The active partner could then present it as supporting documentation in the event of a dispute concerning distribution of partnership profits.

9142,Letter,"India, IB4","Letter from Ḥalfon b. Netanʾel, al-Andalus, to Yosef ha-Levi b. Meʾir Ibn Migash. Dating: probably Tammuz or Av 1138. Written on the fragment of a Fatimid decree. It's unclear whether at the time of writing Ḥalfon and Ibn Migash had already met face-to-face, but they had already corresponded. Written in rhymed, very eloquent prose, which Friedman interprets as evidence of Ḥalfon's adaptation to the values of Andalusī culture. Provides information about Ibn Migash unknown from Avraham Ibn Dawud's Sefer ha-Qabbala, which portrays Ibn Dawud as a Torah scholar, in contrast to his grandfather the courtier (who was forced to flee from Granada to Seville in the first half of the eleventh century); the grandson, born in Seville on 1 Adar 4837 [28 January 1077], studied with Yiṣḥaq al-Fāsī when the latter came to Lucena when Ibn Migash was around 12 years old until he was around 26 years old and was devoted to Torah study. But Friedman notes that the panegyrics that Yehuda ha-Levi wrote for Ibn Migash seem to allude to the grandson's secular pursuits and standing as well. In the final part of this letter, Ḥalfon asks Ibn Migash to accept him as his student, despite the fact that Ḥalfon was at the time around fifty years old. If he doesn't, Ḥalfon explains, he will revert to his plan to return to Egypt. According to Friedman this is a rare or possibly unique example of a medieval letter to a rosh yeshiva asking to be accepted as a student.

The writer asks the recipient to send a message to Rabbi Yiṣḥaq b. Barukh (r12), who was based in Almeria, and to take an oath from him. Also mentions Harūn b. al-Bargeloni, Abu Zikri, Avraham and Avraham (who may be the same person), and Dāwūd and Barukh. Some of these people are probably from Fez, but it is impossible to identify them from other sources. The main concern of the letter is news about various goods sent to Spain and elsewhere, including alum, indigo, gold, copper, lac, scales and weights, ruby wood and paper.

The letter deals with the death of Ḥalfon's brother and other notables and the series of disasters that struck Ḥalfon and the community. Dating: probably January 1140 CE (though Goitein originally believed it to be 1129 CE, he later revised his dating and Friedman agrees). (Information from Goitein and Friedman, India Book IV.) Goitein summarizes the letters as follows: ""A perfect picture of the influence of emotions on physical and mental health is found in the long letter written by the noble India trader Ḥalfon b. Netanel nine months after his return to Egypt from a long sojourn in Spain. As expected from a man like him, he dedicates the first twenty lines to the praise of his gracious and learned hosts, whom he so greatly missed. Then he goes on to bemoan one after another the disasters that disturbed his mind: civil war, anarchy, the high cost of living in Egypt, the death of the Head of the Jerusalem Academy (which then had its seat in Cairo) and of several luminaries of the Jewish spiritual and social upper crust; hardly had the months of mourning for those passed when Halfon's misfortune was topped by the demise of his eldest brother, who was the president of the Jewish High Court of Justice. He found himself unable to act, even to supervise the unloading of his goods, and let the perishables rot. During his long stay in Alexandria his body and soul never enjoyed full health, but he was also unable to bring himself to go up to Cairo: how could he visit the place vacated by his brother? Family and friends came down to Alexandria to induce him to return home, but he did not find in himself nahḍa, energy, to do so. For this reason, he was also not in a position to send to his friends in Spain (mostly physicians) the pharmaceutical plants promised, for these were to be had only in the capital (the terminal of the India trade), not in the Mediterranean port. Nor for the time being was he in a frame of mind to continue writing the learned discussions that were started during his sojourn in Spain. He concludes with a refined twist; he really did not want to send this letter but he was overcome by yearning for his Spanish friends, and asks them, considering his state of mind, to overlook his shortcomings in style and script (in that order).""

Moshe, known as ʿAyn Sarra (Goitein's rendering of the name, ""the son of the man with the gladdening eye(s),"" missed the interlinear addition; Elbaum and Rustow render it ""Happy Eyes""), who told him about how pleasant life was in India, and at least as the writer represents the situation to his brother-in-law — guiltily, as he had left home without saying goodbye — he somewhat spontaneously decided to travel to India. It would be significant if the barriers to entering the Indian Ocean trade were as low as they seem here. Yet he also complains — with puns — about various locations in the Red Sea (ʿAydhāb/ʿadhāb, Dahlak/muhlik, etc), again presumably in order to reassure his brother-in-law that he wasn't actually enjoying himself. On Happy Eyes, Goitein writes that this man had settled in Alexandria, Egypt, where he possessed a valuable house. He also possessed a house in Barqa, eastern Libya. Cf. T-S NS J241. (Goitein, Med.

Property: Ṭabaqat al-Burj (referring to a tower? or to a dovecote?). Period: 10 years. Lessor: Bū l-Faraj Ibn al-Abzārī. Lessee: Bū l-ʿAlāʾ al-Ṣabbāgh. Rent: 12 dirhams/month. (3) Involves Makārim b. Bū l-Riḍā. Details are difficult to discern; involves a house, an inheritance, and a sale. This one is signed: Ḥalfon b. Saʿīd ha-Kohen; עזראהל(??) b. Yefet ha-Melammed.

They will repay the debt over a period of 4 months. Apparently they will pay (the verb used is NQD, ""assay"") the 73.5 dirhams now, to make it a nice round figure. Eliyyahu (b. Zekharya) and Yeḥiel (b. Elyaqim) were the judges present. (7) This entry has been discussed and translated by Moshe Yagur as follows: ""On the margins of the leaf is the first paragraph below, mentioning the birth of a mamzeret (lit. “a bastard girl,” referring to a Jew whose lineage is tainted according to rabbinic law). A paragraph clarifying the reason for the newborn’s legal state is given in perpendicular, noting the conversion of her mother. Thus the document serves as an example of some of the social and legal problems that could result from the marriage of a Jewish apostate. In addition, it suggests enduring ties between converts and their former community, given the prospect that the “bastard” daughter might choose to retain her place in the Jewish community. Translation: A daughter was born to the “son of the known one” (ibn yaʿlamū?) from Bint Ṭuwayr al-ʿAshāʾ, and she is a “bastard” (mamzeret). [It happened] in the year 1532 [of the Seleucid era, corresponding to 616–17/1220–21]. And [she is a bastard] because her mother had apostatized while she was married to Efrayim al-Damīrī, and he did not write a bill of divorce for her, and she married Bu ʿAlī “son of the known one” in a Muslim court [lit. “by non-Jewish law”]."" (Information from Yagur, ""Several Documents from the Cairo Geniza Concerning Conversion to Islam"" (2020).) On the odd name Ṭuwayr al-ʿAshāʾ, perhaps ""evening moth/butterfly,"" see the same name in T-S NS J293c from 80 years earlier and BL OR 5566C.9 (recto l. 26) from slightly earlier than that, and see Goitein's index card #19543 where he wonders if it might be a profession related to the evening meal—but it is clear from the identical name appearing in 3 unrelated documents that Ṭuwayr is part of the name.

The petitioner makes accusations against a Jewish man named Saʿd b. al-ʿAyṣī(?) who held the rights to a capitation tax farm (kāna multazim bi-muqāṭaʿat al-jawālī) but who was caught up in some sort of scandal (unkira ʿalayhi min al-amwāl al-muḥarrara ʿalayhi li-jānib al-dīwān) and had to leave Egypt for a long time. He eventually returned and attached himself to the court of Ḥayyim al-Kapūsī.

He infringes on people's rights, especially the poor and anyone who does not pay him enough of a bribe. The addressees are asked to send two witnesses to observe the truth of these claims and then act against the wicked man. The Hebrew script in the margin likely belongs with the accounts on verso; it does not appear to be a filing note. This document is particularly noteworthy, because the most famous hagiographical anecdote about Ḥayyim Kapūsī (also spelled Capoussi or Capousi) is that he miraculously regained his eyesight after being accused of taking bribes, thereby proving his righteousness and silencing his enemies.

16059,Legal document,,"Legal document in Hebrew. Dated: Monday, 8 Adar I [5293 AM] = 3 February 1533 CE. The specific case was identified by אביחיל מנצורה on FGP in December 2021 as a famous case from the responsa of the time, ""the girl from Tripoli."" The following summary is based entirely on Shlomo Zalman Havlin, תשובת ר׳ שמואל ב״ר משה הלוי בן חכים / בן חקאן, Yeshurun 31 (2014), 41f. 

Yāqūta bt. Sulaymān Būza of Tripoli (Libya) was married at the age of 9 to her cousin Pinḥas b. Baʿdās Būza in 1510 CE, a few months before Tripoli was conquered by Spanish forces (who remained there until 1530). Pinḥas was taken captive, and Yāqūta remained an ʿaguna for 12 years. In the meantime, it was rumored that Pinḥas had converted. Yāqūta and some of her family immigrated to Egypt. Around 1522 CE, they approached the court in Cairo and sought to annul her marriage by bringing witnesses to testify that she was married as a minor without the consent of her father. On the basis of these testimonies, R. Moshe al-Ashqar, R. David Ibn Abi Zimra, and R. Shemuel ha-Levi Ḥaqqan/Ḥakim annulled her marriage to Pinḥas, and she remarried and had children over the following years. In 1525, R. Shemuel Ibn Sid obtained new testimonies from Tripolitans who claimed that the marriage had taken place with her father's consent, and therefore her second marriage was invalid. R. Moshe al-Ashqar claimed that Ibn Sid's receipt of testimony was invalid (it was received at night, Yāqūta was not present, there was no cross-examination, the judges were relatives, and the judges were boors and made an error in writing the date)—so he upheld the second marriage. In 1530/31, Yaʿaqov Beirav obtained further testimonies in Gaza and Jerusalem from Tripolitans and held (no later than 1533) that despite the flaws in Ibn Sid's testimonies, indeed there was no coercion in the first marriage, and her second marriage was invalid and her children illegitimate. R. Shemuel Haqqan and R. Moshe al-Ashqar countered this responsum, and Yaʿaqov Beirav countered their counter-responsum. In 1533, R. Moshe al-Ashqar traveled to Jerusalem and obtained additional testimonies from Yaʿaqov Beirav's new witnesses, together with R. Levi Ibn Habib. They were warned in the strongest possible terms to testify truthfully—and they retracted their earlier testimonies. Al-Ashqar returned to Egypt and declared victory, and Yaquta's second marriage was upheld. R. Eliyyahu b. Binyamin ha-Levi of Istanbul also wrote a responsum on the same issue (in support of Yaquta and her second marriage) and sent it to Moshe al-Ashqar.

The Geniza fragment preserves only the lower right corner of the document and two signatures, but the details match perfectly: ""... on the night of the wedding, that the elder Avraham took her out.... and married her to the aforementioned Pinḥas, on the night of the wedding, against the will of... and it was all against the will of her father and not... and we signed on Monday, the 8th of Adar I...."" Based on the calendar date and the day of the week, the year can only be 5293 AM / 1533 CE, which means that this testimony belongs to the final phase of the controversy. It is signed by none other than Moshe Ibn al-Ashqar and Shemuel (Haqqan/Hakim?) ha-Levi.

Jirjis on recto (this is not entirely clear because of the lacunae — possibly to the elder Abū Mufaḍḍal Hibatallāh b. Ḥasan the Jewish physician, who appears on line 9). The document is signed by the witnesses ʿAbd al-Raḥmān b. ʿAlī b. Aḥmad and Yaḥyā b. Muslim. As is often the case, the subsequent transaction is recorded in a smaller text-block on verso. 

The date in the annotation on both recto and verso, written at a right-angle to the main text of the document, is the last decade of Dhū l-Qa'da 511, a bit less than three months after the deadline for the repayment of the debt.

A Fatimid state official by the title ʿAmīd al-Dawla appears in at least seven documents (see: T-S AS 145.353, BL OR 5561A.2, ENA NS 48.20, CUL Or.1080 J156, T-S 10J21.10, and T-S 10J23.2).

The only benefit is in the slave's service (Ar. muʿāmala = Heb. ʿavoda) of the Truth and fearing Him and carrying out His law and seeking His mercy and fulfilling His commandments... this is the treasure that does not decay and the happiness that never perishes...."" He then offers his sympathy for the recent separation between the addressee and his 'brother' ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz. Previously the two were very close, and it seems they have had a fight. 'The physicians' (al-ḥukamāʾ) were pained when they heard that 'their brother' (ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz?) was the one at fault. The letter concludes, ""Nobody loves evil except every person bereft of intellect and religion, and peace is the wellspring of life, and existence is/was built up only through peace, may God bless His nation with peace.""

19696,Letter,"Constantinople, Byzantium, Mevorakh b. Saadya, Greek, Jewish ministers, al-Afdal","Letter from a Jewish notable who had previously been minister of finance in Egypt, seeking assistance from the Jewish community in Constantinople. This very long letter begins with many lines of poetry and greetings to the Constantinople community, after which the writer describes his fall from favor and how he has now been supplanted by a new Christian minister of finance. The recently deceased Nagid Mevorakh b. Saʿadya's elevation by the Vizier al-Afḍal is described, and the very high regard in which he was held at court. The Nagid's death had presumably left the writer and other Jews in high positions exposed to court intrigue. Dating: soon after 1111 CE (when Mevorakh died). (Information from CUDL.) The writer spells out Greek words in vocalized Hebrew script: ""το πατριαρχη"" (the patriarch) and ""εἰστό Ταμίαθι"" (in Tamiathi = Damietta = Kaftor)."

The sender was informed by al-Peʾer that the farmer/peasant (fallāḥ) with whom the sender had deposited his merchandise is 'coveting' it, i.e., seeking to appropriate it for himself. The sender complains that he is persecuted in this way more than anyone else, and the previous year he also had great trouble getting reimbursed for merchandise that was stolen from him.

A half-dinar and a (mother?-)in-law (ḥamātī) are also mentioned but their place in the story is not entirely clear. He blandishes Abu l-Ḥasan to give him the money immediately because he is in financial straits, and then threatens to take him to court if he fails to pay up. In the last few lines he reverts to speaking to his son, ""This is distressing to me. Go out and take it. He knows that I cannot go out to him.... Whatever you send to me, send it with Musa."" The handwriting and colloquial spellings resemble those of Abu Sahl (Levi) the cantor, the father of Moshe b. Levi ha-Levi, (cf. T-S 13J27.21, T-S 8J10.16, T-S 8J24.1); this is supported by the mention of Musa at the end but still conjectural. ASE."

19934,Letter,Moshe b. Levi,"Extremely faded letter from Moshe b. Levi ha-Levi, Qalyub, to a family member in Fustat. The overall tone is distressed. When the content starts to be (barely) legible in line 16, Moshe is narrating the events following the death of the sister of Sulayman who was the wife of Ya'qub. The family apparently asked Moshe (a cantor) to lead the services. Over 40 people packed into the house incuding a group from al-Mah[allah?]. He started praying, but it seems quietly and to himself. The congregants shouted at him that he had to pray out loud and with 'cantorship' (אלחזאנה) in the 'new' style. Moshe, however, had forgotten how to do this (performance anxiety?) and so he had to continue praying 'without cantorship.' The continuation is unfortunately effaced, and when it is legible again in line 9 of verso, Moshe is probably writing about his sisters ('al-Kabirah' and Fakhr) and mentions a man named Ibn al-'Assar.

It is not clear where the various people are based. Shemuel's father is also in Damietta, but Shemuel's wife is in Gabriel's location. Shemuel writes: ""Always write to me via Rashid to Izmir,"" and, ""God willing, on Sukkot, you will tell me what happened the garments that I will send to Salonica, and God willing, tell me about in Izmir."" Perhaps Gabriel and Shemuel's wife live in Cairo/Fustat, and Shemuel has embarked on a trip to Izmir. Shemuel reports that he is sending some clothing back to (presumably) Cairo/Fustat for his wife (? ""by my sins, I left her practically naked / muy desnuda""). He mentions that he is sending a silk skirt (futa de seda) with R. Ya'aqov Sobrado (?). ""Our brother"" R. Shelomo al-Hanati (אלחאנאטי) and R. David Kivas (דוד כיואס) are also mentioned. Shemuel sends regards to his father-in-law, Tia Havah (or Hannah), Tio Moshe, and Menahem, and to his own ""brother"" יאודה מראלי. This fragment also contains a responsum regarding a Jew who had a Gentile process the parchment for Torah scrolls and tefillin but failed to mark the parchment so that he would know if the Gentile swapped it out.

Shemuel reports that he is sending money to Moshe both with Aliko (?), the factotum (taking ""muchacho"" as the equivalent of ""ghulam"") of Hajji Amir איל נאמראגואי,  and with his own slave איל מוטי. The remainder has to do with a debt to R. Yosef Burgos (?), which he is unable to pay right now. He asks Moshe to speak with him, and Shemuel hopes to pay him later when he travels to Salonica. There is also a note about the bearer of the letter in the margin. He concludes by saying he could not manage to send the purple קוסאקיס (?). ASE."
19988,Letter,"DIMME, merchant, Petition, wool, broker","Letter in Arabic to a certain Amīr [...] al-Dawla wa-[...]hā, perhaps reporting on business setbacks and the imposition of a new tax. The sender begins the letter saying - “the justice of the amīr has engulfed every person” and then expresses his gratitude and prayers for the amīr. He then conveys a prevailing issue on the coast of the upper Nile delta (al-ṣaʿīd al-aʿlā) which has greatly affected the poor and weak. Here, “rusūm” could refer to a new tax levied upon the population. “None of the dīwāns accept them, and they have to pay it in agreement and disagreement. If one of them seeks help, no one lends a helping hand, if they seek solace, no one grants it to them. All of them are in a similar situation.” It seems that when the addressee - the amīr - looked into their affairs, no one was brave enough to convey this in his presence, hence the petitioner is reporting the affairs to him. The text in the margin mentions some form of wool cultivation, clauses of damages and the wool brokers of Ushmunayn and Fayyūm. The name of the Amīr could be Rashīd al-Dawla wa-Muṣīhā but this admittedly is just a guess. YU."

The exact request isn't known due to the fragmentary nature of the document but it could be a positive response to their will to join something.

20000,Letter,"physician, mail-order medicine, distant son, Bilbays, Minyat Ghamr, ashyaf","Letter from a certain Moshe to his son, the physician Avraham. Fragment. In Judaeo-Arabic. What remains is largely taken up with expressions of the preoccupation of the writer and his wife for their son's health. If they receive good news of Avraham, his mother rejoices, and if they receive bad news, she becomes sad and distressed. Moshe and his wife seem to be concerned because Avraham is traveling frequently (r11–15), and perhaps because of something to do with his wife (rm1). On verso, there are repetitive instructions about not allowing a certain man (Avraham's brother?) to go anywhere without taking Avraham's mother with him. At the end of the letter, Moshe reports that he has obtained the ophthalmic medications (ashyāf) from the physician Abū l-Faraj as requested, and has forwarded them along with a letter from the same Abū l-Faraj. Several towns of the Delta are mentioned in the letter: Bilbays, Minyat Ghamr, and—if this a place name—al-Ṣāliḥiyya. Avraham responded on the same piece of paper, writing nothing more than that he read the letter and thanked God for the health of his father and mother and the children.

20768,Letter,aodeh,"Business letter(s) in Arabic script. Dating: Likely 11th century. This is a bifolio which seems to have excerpts from four different letters, one per page, although Aodeh understood it to be a single letter. It's not clear if it's a letterbook from a trader's personal archive or perhaps a set of model letters to emulate. Aodeh also speculated that it might be from Daniel b. ʿAzarya, based on the mention of Ḥusām al-Dawla (as in Daniel b. ʿAzarya's letters T-S 13J8.8 and T-S 10J20.8 + T-S 10J5.22; however, Aodeh also acknowledges that other traders mention Ḥusām al-Dawla, as in T-S 10J15.19).

Fol. 1r: Letter containing congratulations for the holiday and ordering 20 baskets of aromatic wood. Written on Friday, 26 Rabīʿ II.

Fol. 1v: Letter to a qāḍī titled Muʿtamid al-Dawla wa-Ḥisnuhā. Aodeh identifies him as Qirwāsh b. al-Muqallad of Mosul, but this seems far-fetched. Cf. T-S Ar.39.464 for another Muʿtamid al-Dawla. The sender rebukes him for failing to purchase the 15 dinars' worth of gallnuts he had ordered. He now inquires about the price of linseed oil in the addressee's location and orders 20 dinars' worth if the price is good.

Fol. 2r: Letter reporting that the sender had sent merchandise with Abū l-Maʿālī. He reiterates an earlier request for 20 qinṭārs of flax. A new letter may begin in l. 8, with blessings for Ḥusām al-Dawla.

Fol. 2v: Letter opening with poetic praises for somebody and reporting that the sender received from Abū l-Manṣūr b. [...] al-ʿAsqalānī massive amounts of agricultural produce: 120 irdabbs of wheat, 500 irdabbs of barley, 10,000 irdabbs of chickpeas, 400 irdabbs of fava beans, and 10 raṭls of gallnuts."
20912,State document,Mamluks,"Petition from an official. Dating: Likely 13th or 14th century (this can be narrowed if the person named is known from chronicles). Mentions an amir named ʿAlam al-Dīn Sanjar al-Maḥmūdī; a granary (shūna); a complaint about another official's irregular behavior; how the sender took the aforementioned sum of money to the treasury, but the Dīwān al-Murtajaʿ (Bureau of Reclamation) interfered. The sender now asks the addressee to issue an order (wa-suʾāl al-mamlūk khurūj al-amr al-ʿālī) to the dīwān. Apparently the petitioner was an official who had collected taxes in kind and sold them for 1400 dīnārs, but a group of Mamlūks came along and one of them, ʿIlm al-Dīn Sanjar al-Maḥmūdī, took 29 dinars from what the petitioner had collected, and now the group of Mamluks was withholding the 29 dinars from the fisc. So the petitioner is reporting it immediately and bringing the rest of the money (presumably 1371 dinars) to the fisc and asking to be credited for collecting the full amount."
20935,State document,"DIMME, Petition","State document, in Arabic script.

The addressee might be Badr al-Jamālī (d. 1094; the first in Egypt to hold the title Amir al-Juyūsh). But Khan has argued that the taqbīl clause is not found in petitions before the period of al-Āmir (1101–30 CE), so the addressee may be a later vizier (all of them from Badr through Saladin technically held the title Amīr al-Juyūsh as well). None of the content of the petition is preserved. The space between the lines seems to have been filled in with a legal document or draft in Arabic script, in smaller handwriting. The text on verso may be related but is quite faded."

Letter of a Fatimid dāʿī addressed to a chief qāḍī to congratulate him on a new honor the caliph had bestowed on him — presumably his appointment to the office of chief qāḍī. Were he not prevented by some impediment, he writes, he would have congratulated him in person, since he owes much to the addressee's noble family for the benefactions he has received from the addressee's grandfather and father, both of whom were chief qāḍīs. The name of the caliph is too faded to read, but Stern guesses it was al-Ẓāhir li-iʿzāz dīn allāh based on the length of the space in which case the chief qāḍī was Qāsim b. ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz b. Muḥammad b. al-Nuʿmān, appointed in 418H. The writer also refers to an innovation he had made in the routine of his office: there used to be two assemblies, and in one, someone did something (the context is difficult to grasp) in the presence of the believers (Ismāʿīlīs). Appears also to mention the Dʿāʾim of al-Qāḍī al-Nuʿmān. Another meeting took place on Fridays in the jāmiʿ. The innovation the writer introduced was to have a third session on Friday after the service in each of the main mosques (probably ʿAmr in Fustat, Azhar and Anwār/al-Ḥākim). If he received any majālis, he would read them out, according to custom. (Information from S. M. Stern, ""Cairo as a Centre of the Ismaili Movement"" at n. 16.)

23030,State document,Petition,"Fatimid fiscal report or account for the fiscal (kharājī) year 417, from the period of the Fatimid caliph al-Ẓāhir. Dated: 417 kharājī/419 AH. Document is dated according to both systems, so useful for correlating the fiscal (kharājī) and hijrī calendars.

About the join: Khan published T-S B12.39. Rustow subsequently found the join to T-S 12.1 (December 2020). This is not a continuous join; the bottom of a letter is visible at the top of the second fragment. The two fragments are nonetheless in the same hand, the paper is of the same width (28 cm), and the same scribe has reused them for Hebrew-script texts (T-S B12.39: Aramaic targum to Isaiah 22; T-S 12.1: drafts of legal deeds, including a testimony datable ca. 1090 CE on verso; a ketubba dated 1081 CE; and a quittance; see CUDL for details). This suggests that the scribe acquired a single rotulus and cut it into smaller sheets. The gap of more than 50 years between the original document and the reuse is notable. Should be compared with T-S 12.821 + ENA 3682.5 for a further possible join. (Information from Marina Rustow)"

23405,Letter,,"Letter in Judaeo-Arabic. Quite long, and written in an elegant script. The sender gives a convoluted account of a business/legal dispute, involving stakes of over 150 dinars and the underhanded tactics of another merchant. This man was preparing to travel to the West from Rashīd. He gave his merchandise to his wife and his daughter, so that when the Jews asked his father and brother where his goods were, they said ""we have nothing, it's all with his wife."" Then the women interrogated the wife, who said that she had only 2 dinars and 2 qirats. Her father rebuked her for admitting this, saying that now all of the husband's creditors would come and demand their due. She then reneged on her declaration before the judge. The story goes on. The sender hopes that the addressee will write a letter supporting his side of the case to the judge. Places mentioned: Tripoli (Libya) and 'the West.' People mentioned: ʿAmmār b. al-Dayyān, ʿImrān, Ibn Shammārī, a Rayyis who died, and aṣḥabunā al-Barqiyyīn wa-l-Ghurabā (associates from al-Barqa and the West). Needs further examination.

The writer hopes to be able to get out of (collecting the tax?) debt of the city of Fayyūm before Yom Kippur, but is not optimistic, because the official order on the decree (al-amr ʿalā l-marsūm al-karīm) is unchanged. (The scenario may be similar to that of T-S K2.96 (PGPID 18940), a tax farmer's petition for an exemption from government service which was denied, from the same period.) The blessing for the sultan ""may his glory be strengthened"" (ʿazza naṣruhū) is metonymically applied to either his decree (al-marsūm) or his order/rescript (al-amr). The sender also reports that he has sent a copy of the introduction to the commentary on Avot (probably of Maimonides), and asks the addressees to 'complete it' through the eighth chapter and send it back to him along with the copy of Sefer ha-Madaʿ (the first section of the Mishneh Torah) that they had promised.

If it dates to 1058 or earlier, then it is probably addressed to al-Yāzūrī, the vizier of al-Mustanṣir from 1050 to 1058.

Saʿadya, in office 1094–1111) and requested guidance concerning the case of R. Maṣliaḥ (this is probably not Maṣliaḥ b. Shelomo Gaʾon, since he arrived in Egypt ca. 1127, but this possibility should be entertained). It seems the Nagid gave his response to the sender, who has been in charge of this case since its beginning. He has heard that the addressee wants to be involved somehow.

He asks 'Sayyidnā' to send an advance of 25 dirhams toward the price of the quires (the remainder of the price of the two volumes to be paid upon completion). The only reason he has not finished before Rosh Hashana is that he has been exerting himself trying to find parchment. There follows another similar update on a different project.

The addressee must write urgently in this matter, even if he has to write at night. (It's not clear what the word אלגבר means here, but it may refer somehow to the morning dawning.) Mentions Ibn Nabhān and how this person took the price of the ḥadīda (a kind of bracelet) from him. There are brief greetings at the end, and a request to meet with al-Muhadhdhab and pass on a rebuke from the sender. There are two lines of Arabic script on verso, which may be the same line repeated twice, likely poetry or a cryptic saying, some words: تحمل اثارها . . . ولو اعطيت . . . سمسمة.

Her arguments were as follows: her husband left her for a short time and did not intend to spend the winter away from home; however, by that time he had already been absent more than six months. In order to support herself, she had had to sell whatever remained of her dowry. Even when he is present, he is abusive.

This latter request was immediately met; but a decision on the former request was delayed, with the hope that the husband would soon return. Because the husband delayed his return, and she repeated her requests for help, it was decided to grant the woman an allowance on a temporary basis.

It is interesting to note the ethical note introduced into this medical business by the sentence: 'since my entire aim in this matter is to seek the nearness to God'. The writer presumably means that through preserving health it is possible to better devote onself to the service of God. This brings to mind another similar request addressed to Maimonides in a letter published by D. H. Baneth [see the autograph letter published by Baneth, ""Me-halifat ha-Mikhtavin shel ha-Rambam"", Studies in Memory of Asher Gulak and Samuel Klein, pp. 50 ff.]: 'I desire from your bounty, my lord--since you, together with God, can heal my soul and its organs, so that it can employ itself in the study of the sciences--to prescribe for me what I should eat, since this is necessary, so that I can more easily understand these matters [the philosophical problems described in the first part of the letter]'.

In this version: he describes how he saw the recipient in the kitchen on Sunday and an idea occurred to him that the recipient approved of (possibly to travel to somewhere other than Bilbays?). However, the writer decided it would be better for him to travel to Bilbays. He has not traveled yet, because it is unthinkable to travel when the doors of the house are still in their sorry state: the main door needs to be fixed, and the door of the upper floor/apartmnet needs to be replaced completely. He alludes in very vague terms to his personal difficulties (according to the other copy, a febrile illness since Friday). He then gives his excuse for not having come to attend the recipient (before he traveled?) as requested; he says merely that he had a good reason (in the other copy, he cites his fever) and that he cut off his prayers and tried to fulfill the command.

Moshe, plausibly a fatwa that he had sent for Maimonides to answer (such as T-S 10K8.3 + T-S 8K13.8, in his handwriting); or it is just someone else named R. Moshe. He brings up a man named Isma'il from al-Mahallah, known as Ibn al-Mu'allim; at the end he encourages the recipient to treat this Isma'il well, because he is poor and a stranger and from a good family. Isma'il has a notebook stashed with a man named Ibn al-[[rubbed out]], and the recipient is meant to retrieve it and find the chapters having to do with love [spells?]. The recipient is then to ""do them"" to various women in the family of Moshe's paternal uncle (so the brother of the likely recipient) including the uncle's wife, his mother, and her daughter (=Moshe's wife?). This reading is uncertain. But other letters of Moshe survive about his sometimes problematic relationship with his wife and also about domestic problems in his paternal uncle's family.

The first and last line read: ""O Rabbi David, the Jews are suffering in your absence, our friends are stricken and our enemies are gloating."" At the bottom of fol. 1r, more of the story emerges: the speakers repent of having wronged Rabbi David (niḥnā qad asaynā fī ḥaqqak) and mourn that those who have replaced him in leading prayers and giving the sermon are no match for him. It is tempting to connect this poem to the deposition and later reinstatement of David I Maimonides (cf. the English edition of Goitein and Friedman, India Traders, pp.115–16 and BL Or. 5549.4). The two folios under this shelfmark also contain half a page of a Hebrew poem and a full page of a macaronic Hebrew/Arabic poem consisting of verses rhyming on ""حو/חו.""

32721,State document,Petition,"Petition opening to a vizier of al-Ḥāfiẓ. Dating: 531–33/1137–39.

Khan believes the vizier addressed in the petition is likely Riḍwān ibn Walakhshī because the titles correspond to the ones bestowed on him by al-Ḥāfiẓ in a document copied by al-Qalqashandī (Ṣubḥ VIII, 345): al-sayyid al-ajall al-afḍal amīr al-juyūsh sayf al-islām nāṣir al-ānām kāfil quḍāt al-muslimīn wa-hādī duʿāt al-muʾminīn. The title of Bahrām, attested in no. 5 of Stern’s corpus of Fāṭimid decrees, was al-sayyid al-ajall amīr al-juyūsh sayf al-islām nāṣir al-imām ghiyāṯ al-ānām. The phrases kāfil quḍāt al-muslimīn wa-hādī duʿāt al-muʾminīn were omitted from his titulature, probably because he was Christian. The titulature of the ephemeral Yānis was no doubt similar. Al-Maqrīzī (Ḵiṭāṭ II, 16) records his title as amīr al-juyūsh sayf al-islām. Ibn Muyassar (Aḵbār Miṣr, 117) and Ibn al-Qalānisī (Dhayl tārīkh Dimashq, 229) describe him as amīr al-juyūsh.

The writer then sent the delegate/appointee back to the amīr Shujāʿ al-Dawla with a copy of the Noble Letter which was sent in this regard. He also mentions the case of the amīr Majd al-Dawla and explains that Ibn Dardār or someone else hadn't messed up but rather the cause was what he had mentioned in the previous letter.

The writer is writing about his desire to construct (a room?) on the floor above him which was with the consent of the addressee (على ما كانت املاء) but the neighbors barred him from doing so. The construction on the top floor wouldn't create a problem for them and all he desires is to study ""the lofty knowledge"" so that he fulfills the Sharia's due on him and expresses his gratitude to the addressee (may God extend his benefactions over him and protect him throughout his lifetime).

Khan cites copious sources on Abū l-Barakāt Yuḥannā b. Abī l-Layth, the head of the Diwān al-Taḥqīq (aka Dīwān al-Majlis), 501–27 AH: ""Al-Afḍal established an office known as dīwān al-taḥqīq in the year 501 AH and appointed as its head the Christian Abu al-Barakāt Yuḥannā b. Abī l-Layth. Yuḥannā remained in this appointment until he was removed in 527 AH and was killed in 528 AH (Ibn Muyassar, Akhbār Miṣr, 77, 108, al-Nuwayri, Nihāyat al-'arab XXVI, 81; al-Maqrīzī, ltti'āẓ al-ḥunafāʾ III, 39, 43, 75, 126, 148, Khiṭaṭ I 441, 488 [= Ibn al-Maʾmūn, Akhbār Miṣr, 21, 11]). The dīwān al-taḥqīq regulated the activities of the other government offices. According to Ibn al-Maʾmūn the office that was instituted in 501 AH and headed by Yuḥannā b. Abī l-Layth was the dīwān al-majlis (aI-MaqrlzI, Khiṭaț I, 401; Ibn aI-Ma'mūn, Akhbār Miṣr, 9). This appears to be the same office. Some sources, in fact, refer to the office as dīwān al-taḥqīq wa-l-majlis, e.g. aI-Shayyāl, Majmūʿat al-wathāʾiq al-Fāṭimiyya, 325:14. Elsewhere Ibn aI-Maʾmūn refers to Yuḥannā as mutawallī dīwān al-majlis wa-l-khaṣṣ (aI-Maqrlzi, Khiṭaṭ I, 412:3-4, Ibn aI-Ma'mūn, Akhbār Miṣr, 53:1).""

He reports that he is revered, because he has successfully humiliated all the competing cantors, and now nobody dares to chant in his presence. (The father seems to be a cantor as well.) His father was upset that he entered the service of ""someone like the ghulām""; Manṣūr will explain everything when he arrives.

He complains about the lack of sustenance in Damascus. He claims to fast most days out of sorrow/longing, and he repeatedly asks for prayers.

He asks for news of potential fiancees back home—his cousin (bint ʿamm) and Nabaʾ—since the locals in Damascus are trying to set him up with a local woman. He emphasizes that he would never get married with his father absent. He alludes to a period of a year when he had a falling-out with his father, a rift which is now healed (this may explain some of the over-the-top language of longing in this letter). He asks for some aqwāl, which should be sent to the house of the Nezer along with instructions to forward them to Aleppo should the son have traveled already.

Opens with four lines of biblical verses in Hebrew commonly referred to as צידוק הדין, then continues in Judaeo-Arabic. The deceased seems to be female family member named ʿAzīza, who left orphaned girls behind (ll. 10–11). The sender says that the pain of her bereavement is equal to the pain that she experienced when her brother (Ṣedaqa's father) died (ll. 5–6). She invokes the trope that it is best not to grieve for too long, ""because it does no good, all I have gained from sorrow and weeping is blindness."" If God sends health to the addressee and his family, they should inform her (the nature of their ailment is not clear, whether it is an organic disease, or illness on account of grief, or something in between). Greetings to Mūsā and to all the addressee's sisters again. Abū ʿAlī, Hiba, and Surūr send their condolences.

35703,Legal document,,"Recto: Legal query in Judaeo-Arabic. Addressed to Yiṣḥaq the judge (perhaps Yiṣḥaq b. Sasson from the court of Maimonides). Concerns a business partnership between a Muslim and a Jew. The Muslim took the profit from the partnership and then terminated the partnership. The Jew then drew up an Islamic legal document (hujja) and threatened to imprison the Muslim, whereupon they renegotiated the amount of money owed according to the terms of the partnership. The Jewish guy makes a new calculation of the old and new debits and credits and has these new terms drawn up in a Jewish legal document (shetar) in front of a Jewish court (beit din). The query: if the Muslim partner sues the Jew in the beit din and accuses him using the shetar as his documentation, is it permissible for one of them to deny (the validity of) the shetar, and to oblige the other to take an oath swearing that he doesn’t owe the other guy any additional money on account of the prohibition on interest (ribit), or can a punishment be imposed on him on account of the oath?

38401,Letter,,"Fragment of a large and beautifully-written letter or sermon addressed to a community. In the hand of Ḥalfon b. Menashshe ha-Levi (1100–38 CE). The purpose is to recommend a scholar for support or employment. Similar genre as T-S 6J7.19 (PGPID 17150), but probably not directly related. 

As described by Mark Cohen: ""It announces, with stylistic flourish, the arrival in Egypt of a great Talmudic scholar from Narbonne, France, by the name of Yiṣḥaq. Our Yehuda is mentioned en passant in a revealing passage: ""This year there arrived in Egypt (diyār miṣr) from a town in Europe (diyār al-[r]ūm) called Narbonne—the town famous for its scholars (ʿulamāʾ) and righteous men (fuḍalāʾ)—a man whose superior in knowledge, piety, and reverence has not arrived from those parts (min tilka al-diyār) since the great rav (al-rav al-kabīr), our master Yehuda Rosh ha-Seder, may his memory be blessed."" It seems virtually certain that the great rav Yehuda Rosh ha- Seder referred to posthumously in this passage is identical with Yehuda b. Yosef ha-Kohen. The letter implies, therefore, that he had arrived from a Christian country, possibly Italy (usually termed ""the land of al-rūm"" in the Geniza), and had, therefore, obtained at least part of his learning within a non- Islamic environment. Quite likely, he had also spent time in an Arabic-speaking Jewish community (Qayrawān?) prior to settling in Egypt around 1050"" (Cohen, Jewish Self-Government, 106–07; transliterations adjusted for PGP style). M. A. Friedman, ""A Responsum by the 'Rav' Judah b. Joseph ha-Kohen Concerning a Child Bride who Committed Adultery"" [Hebrew] Dine Yisrael (2000), 331, accepts that the identification of Yehuda Rosh ha-Seder with Yehuda b. Yosef ha-Kohen is probably correct; Marina Rustow, ""The Diplomatics of Leadership,"" (2014), questions whether there is sufficient evidence to confirm this identification."

A series of colophons copied with slight changes in various places throughout the manuscript (at the begining and middle of each of the five books) document its transfer between several known and important figures.

The first colophon is that of the copyist, Shemuel b. Yaʿaqōv,  the known scribe active in the first dwo decades of the eleventh century in Fusṭāṭ, who was also the scribe behind the 'Leningrad Codex'. 
The manuscript's first owner was Shelomo ha-Paqid (the representative of the merchants) b. Avraham, active in Tyre in the early 11th century, and mentioned in several Geniza douments (see PGPID 1761).

The second documented ownership of the manuscript is when the Head of the Court (Av Bet Din) Shelomo b. Eliyahu Kohen Gaon purchased it for his son, Ṣadōq, on 1084, in Tyre. This colophon (recurring throughout the manuscript) was written in Hebrew by ʿAmram b. Ṣedaqa, a known scribe in Tyre at the time (see for example PGPID 764, and further references there).

The third ownership is that of ""Sitt al-Kull Mubāraka, the daughter of the Gaon"" - an unknown figure thus far.

The fourth ownership colophon documents the owner as ʿOvadya b. ʿUlla ""the honorable prince"", who is the same ʿOvadya/ʿAbdallāh whose appointment as the leader of all Jewish communities in al-Shām in 1193 is documented in PGPID 9436. ʿOvadya's ancestry is detailed in the colophon for five generations, and some of his family members are known from Geniza documents and colophons from 12th century Egypt. See the family's lineage in PGPID 12713.

All colophons transcribed here are from page 129 in the second volume, except the first and last colphons which are on the first and last pages of the manuscript, respectively.

The fifth and last ownership colophon is written in Judao-Arabic. It bears the date 28th of Marḥeshvan 1598 Sel., which is 24.11.1286. The person who purchased the manuscrupt was Abū Ṣāliḥ ha-Kohen, ""pride of the scribes"", son of Peraḥya the physician."

The trader was normally in Egypt, but was writing from Amūl in Ṭabaristān. He is heading back to Egypt, but since he's elderly, he doesn't think he can make it all the way back to Egypt, and anyway has heard that it's not a good time to be in Egypt (presumably because of the caliph al-Ḥākim), so he's planning to stop in Aleppo. When he was in Baghdad, he deposited money with a Jewish banker, Shelomo b. Aharon, against a bill of exchange from the Tustarīs and Sahlawayh b. Ḥayyim in Egypt. The purpose of the letter appears to be to ask the Tustarīs to arrange access to the money in Aleppo instead. Very interesting from the point of view of how bills of exchange worked internationally. Also interesting is that the writer — a native Persian speaker — writes suftajā with a צ instead of a ג as in Arabic. The manuscript was once in the possession of the secretary of the Egyptian Geographical Society, a certain Meunier; it was still there when Itzhak Ben Zvi edited the text in 1938. Gil re-edited it on the basis of the photograph in the Ben Zvi Institute. It appears to have no entry in FGP. (Information in part from Gil) MR"

39143,Letter,,"Letter from Sherira bar Ḥananya Gaʾon and Hayye bar Sherira to Yaʿaqov b. ʿAwkal enclosing letters for Yaʿaqov b. Nissim in Qayrawān. It is unknown where this manuscript is today. Long story short: this shelfmark refers to a copy of the manuscript made by Firkovich. (Longer version: Gil published the text on the basis of the editio princeps, made by Alexander Marx in ""Studies in Gaonic History and Literature,"" JQR n.s. 1 (1910): 101, having copied it from what Marx calls Codex Steinschneider 29, ""which for the most part contains liturgical fragments,"" folios 19-20 — although apparently Steinschneider himself designated it CnP1. Gil says that he attempted to locate the text at JTS and failed, but then labels it ""Unidentified Firkovitch."" This seems puzzling until one reads Benjamin Richler, ""Steinschneider's Manuscripts,"" which explains that after Steinschneider died in 1907, Marx was able to purchase 25 of Steinschneider's manuscripts for the JTS library, in addition to his archives and about two dozen notebooks containing bibliographical notes and copies of manuscripts. One of these notebooks, now JTS MS 4391, which Richler calls ""one of the more curious items in Steinschneider's library,"" contains copies of piyyutim and other fragments in the hand of Firkovich, which Firkovich sent to Steinschneider, ""perhaps for his appraisal, perhaps as a gift."" So what's at JTS is a copy, and if the original fragment surfaces, it will probably surface in St. Petersburg. MR"
